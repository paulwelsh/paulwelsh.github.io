        <h1>Business Intelligence Reporting</h1>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> Beginning on 4/26/2011, we have temporarily enabled estimated costing information (your profit and our commission) for our on-screen reports. This short-term change will allow us to complete some enhancements to Business Intelligence and Business Navigator reports. When costing information has been temporarily enabled for a report, that fact will be noted in on-screen text, and on the associated help page.</p>
        <p>Business Intelligence reporting is eSellerate's enhanced data and reporting solution. This is the option to use for finding your profit and eSellerate's commission on your orders from 4/1/2011 and later.</p>
        <p>The benefits of this solution include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enhanced reports – You get the reports you need, with the ability to look at different trends.</li>
            <li>Create your own reports – You have the option to create the reports you want to regularly see, with any of the multiple data points available.</li>
            <li>Export reports – You have the ability to export individual reports, specific data points or your reports that you create.</li>
            <li>Report scheduling tool – You can automatically set up a report to be processed daily, weekly, or monthly and have these reports available to you through in-screen viewing or e-mail in the selected format (CSV, semicolon, text pipe, HTML table, Excel Classic, XLSX OpenXML, XML eXtensible Markup Language).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are two options for reporting:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Business Intelligence reports allow a quick visual view on different data points.</li>
            <li>Business Navigator reports allow customization and data extraction. They also include scheduling and "save views" options for further customization.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To get to Business Intelligence reporting, go to the My Reports section of affiliates.esellerate.net, and near the bottom of the page, click either <span class="strong">Business Intelligence Reports</span> or <span class="strong">Business Navigator Reports</span>.
