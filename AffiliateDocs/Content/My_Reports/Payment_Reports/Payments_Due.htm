        <h1>Payments Due</h1>
        <p>This report shows details on your next payment. <br /></p>
        <h5>To access Payments Due report information: </h5>
        <ol>
            <li>For more information about an upcoming payment, click its <span class="strong">Payment ID</span> field. The resulting page will include a publisher sales summary (which you can view by publisher or SKU) and a listing of any adjustment items. </li>
            <li>For more payment details, use one of the following Payment Transaction Ledger options: <ul><li>Click <span class="strong">View </span>to see the results in an HTML table. </li><li>Click <span class="strong">Export(CSV)</span> to export the results as a comma-delimited file. </li></ul></li>
        </ol>
        <h5>If you selected View: </h5>
        <p>The table will display all transactions involved in this payment. </p>
        <h5>If you selected Export(CSV): </h5>
        <p>The resulting Save As dialog will display a default file name, which you can change if desired. In any case, you will need to change the file extension to ".csv" before saving the file (applies to both Windows and Macintosh platforms).</p>
        <p>You can now import the file into a database, or open it in a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel. (If a program prompts you to specify a format for this data, select comma-delimited or comma-separated values.)</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> Your sales will first appear as a simple total in the Sales Receivable report, and then move to this report when eSellerate processes your payment.</p>
