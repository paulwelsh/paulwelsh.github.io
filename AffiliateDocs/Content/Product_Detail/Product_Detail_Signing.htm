        <h2>Digitally Signing eST Downloads</h2>
        <p>As an additional security feature, eSellerate digitally signs eST files at the time that you or your customers download them from our servers. The signatures make it possible for end users to verify that the files originated from a trusted source (in this case, eSellerate), and have not been altered since the signing.</p>
        <h5>Notes:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>If you use the Downloadable eST option, the digital signatures for eST files that you host on your affiliate web site will periodically expire. In that instance, you should re-download the eST files from eSellerate's servers, and make the updates available on your web site.</li>
            <li>If you use the Hosted eST option, your customers will always be able to download eST files that have current digital signatures.</li>
        </ul>
