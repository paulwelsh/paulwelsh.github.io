        <h2>eST and Virus Protection Software</h2>
        <p>eSellerate has successfully and extensively tested eST downloads through Norton and McAfee virus protection software. For eST downloads launched from a removable drive (such as CD or floppy), version 4.5.0 of McAfee's VirusScan software (with or without Service Pack 1) may report the eST download as a virus. Users of version 4.5.0 who receive this intermittent error can resolve the issue with the VSC450o HotFix, which is available by request through McAfee Support. This change has already been incorporated into later releases of VirusScan.</p>
