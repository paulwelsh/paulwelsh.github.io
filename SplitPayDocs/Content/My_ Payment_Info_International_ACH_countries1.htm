        <h3>Entering Payment Information for International ACH</h3>
        <p>Help in locating the required information on checks from bank accounts in Australia, Canada and France follows.</p>
        <p><b>Australia<br /></b>The required information includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A five- to nine-digit account number</li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:xref href="My_Payment_Info_SWIFT.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Bank SWIFT&#160;BIC</MadCap:xref>
            </li>
            <li>A six-digit international routing code for the bank (called a BSB number, which stands for Bank, State, Branch). The BSB number consists of a two-digit bank number, a one-digit state number and a three-digit branch number. For example, if the BSB number is 032001, 03 is the bank number, 2 is the state number and 001 is the branch number. Do not include a dash or any other symbols.</li>
            <li>The currency of the country where the bank is located</li>
