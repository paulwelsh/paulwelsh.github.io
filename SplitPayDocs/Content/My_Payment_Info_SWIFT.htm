        <h1>Bank SWIFT&#160;BIC</h1>
        <p>If your payment type is international ACH or international wire, your required payment information will include bank SWIFT BIC. Information on SWIFT appears below. </p>
        <p>SWIFT is a worldwide community that is used by more than 7,000 financial institutions in 197 countries to connect one another. Collectively, these institutions, active in payments, securities, treasury and trade services, exchange millions of messages valued in trillions of dollars every business day. In order for eSellerate to transfer your eSellerate payment to your bank successfully, our bank will need to communicate with your bank through the SWIFT community. Please ask your banker for your institution's SWIFT code.</p>
