            <MadCap:keyword term="terms of sale:creating" />Creating Terms of Sale</h2>
        <p>This feature allows you to specify terms that the customer must agree to before purchasing one of your products through <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" />. You will assign terms of sale at the SKU level, so each of your SKUs may use its own terms. When a customer clicks the Buy button for one of these SKUs, your eSeller will display the appropriate Terms of Sale screen. For information about assigning terms of sale, see <MadCap:xref href="../SKU_Management/SKU_Advanced.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Setting the SKU's Advanced Properties (Optional)</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h5>To create a terms of sale item:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the <span class="strong">Terms of Sale</span> tab. The Terms of Sale List page appears.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="strong">New</span>. The Terms of Sale Detail page appears.<br /><img src="../Resources/Images/account_terms.jpg" class="PWimg" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" /></li>
            <li> In the <span class="strong">Name </span>field, enter the name for this terms of sale item. (There is a 50-character limit.) The name is for internal identification purposes only, and will not be visible to your customers.</li>
            <li>In the bottom field, enter the terms that you want to display to your customers. (Use plain text only.)</li>
            <li>Click <span class="strong">Save Changes</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> Although Web Store and Embedded Web Store eSellers will display as many Terms of Sale screens as necessary, Integrated eSellers will display a Terms of Sale screen only for the primary SKU. If you need to display terms of sale for your Integrated eSellers' cross-sell SKUs, one solution is to use installers to provide that functionality.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> Integrated eSellers require a special setting to display terms of sale as described here. For this, you will need to go to the eSeller's Software Delivery Wizard settings and select the <span class="strong">Override Terms with SKU Terms of Sale</span> check box. See <MadCap:xref href="../Integrated_eSellers/Integrated_CreatingeSell.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Creating an Integrated eSeller</MadCap:xref>.</p>
