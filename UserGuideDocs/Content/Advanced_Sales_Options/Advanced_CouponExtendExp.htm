        <p>After you activate a coupon that uses an expiration date, its Coupon Details page will allow you to extend the expiration (as long as the date has not yet passed).</p>
        <p>Enter a date in the <span class="strong">New End Date</span> field and click <span class="strong">Extend Expiration Date</span>. You can extend the expiration date as many times as needed while the coupon is still valid.</p>
