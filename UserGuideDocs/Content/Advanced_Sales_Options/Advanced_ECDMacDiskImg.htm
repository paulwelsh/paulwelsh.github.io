        <p>If you use a Mac OS 9 disk image file (.img) with eCD, the image will be extracted to the root of the CD. </p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Caution:</span> Before you upload a Mac OS 9 disk image file for use with eCD, you must save the file in one of the following formats: MacBinary (.bin), BinHex (.hqx) or StuffIt (.sit). Be sure to retain the ".img" file extension. For instance, a Mac OS 9 disk image file named "Diskimage1.img" becomes "Diskimage1.img.bin" when saved as MacBinary.</p>
