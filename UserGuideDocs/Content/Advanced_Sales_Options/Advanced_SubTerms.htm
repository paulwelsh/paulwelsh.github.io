        <p>The Terms tab of the Subscription Detail page shows the terms and conditions that customers must agree to before purchasing a SKU that uses the selected subscription method.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> If a subscription SKU has terms of sale assigned to it, those terms will display before the subscription terms and conditions. The customer must agree to all applicable terms before purchasing the subscription SKU. See also <MadCap:xref href="../Account_Management/Account_Terms.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Creating Terms of Sale</MadCap:xref>.<br /></p>
        <p>The static text shown on the Terms tab reflects the duration, billing frequency and renewal type (automatic or manual) that you have set for the subscription method on the Details tab. This content is non-editable. If you would like to provide additional text to supplement the non-editable content for terms and/or cancellation policy, enter it in the fields provided. These fields accept up to 4,000 characters each (plain text only). You can leave the additional text fields blank if desired.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> The static text shown on the Terms tab may include placeholders such as "&lt;Sku Name&gt;" for information that will be filled in at the time of purchase.  The actual information will be visible when you run preview purchases to test your subscriptions.<br /></p>
        <p>When you finish entering additional text, click <span class="strong">Save</span>.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note: </span>Once you activate a subscription method, you will not be able to edit the additional text fields.<br /></p>
