        <h2>Channels: Change Control</h2>
        <p>When you accept a SKU that a publisher has submitted, <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> copies the 
				SKU and its accompanying product into your channel. Because the channel items 
				are copies, you can customize individual settings if desired without affecting 
				the source items within the publisher's account. However, the reverse is not 
				always true for changes that the publisher can make to the source items, as 
				explained here.</p>
        <p>Some changes that the publisher can make to source SKUs will have an effect 
						on the corresponding items in your channel. You will receive e-mail notification 
						of these types of changes. One such notification is a notice of SKU deletion, 
						which will instruct you to remove any links from your channel web site to the 
						associated SKU as soon as possible. The other notifications fall into two categories: 
						changes that you can accept or reject, and changes that are effective immediately 
						for the associated SKU within your channel. If you have the option to accept 
						or reject the publisher's changes, the notification will include instructions 
					on how to do that. Those instructions also appear below.</p>
        <h5>To process SKU changes:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li> Select a change that you want to review.</li>
            <li>To accept the change, which will update the associated SKU within your channel, 
							click <span class="strong">Accept</span>. Otherwise, to reject the change, which will leave the associated 
						SKU within your channel as is, click <span class="strong">Reject</span>. </li>
            <li>Repeat steps 1-2 for all pending SKU changes.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> There is no automated e-mail sent to the publisher when you accept or 
					reject changes.</p>
