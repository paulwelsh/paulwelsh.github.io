        <h2>Channel List</h2>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> Channels program enables sales partnerships between channel 
			web sites and software publishers. If a channel offers to sell your products, 
			you will work out an agreement with the channel offline, and then use the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> 
			Sales Manager to accept the agreement.</p>
        <p><strong>Notes on the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> Channels program</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To participate in the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> Channels program, you need an 
						eSellerate SplitPay account. If you do not have a SplitPay account, you can create one 
					at <a href="http://splitpay.esellerate.net/" target="_blank">http://SplitPay.eSellerate.net</a>.</li>
            <li>The Sales Manager provides three options for finding information about channel 
						orders: the Orders search, the Returns search and the Channel SKU Sales by 
						Date Range report. These are the only Sales Manager options that account for 
					channel orders.</li>
            <li>Customers that purchase your products through a channel are instructed to 
						contact you for product support. To look up these customers' orders for support 
						purposes, use the <a href="../Order_Management/Orders_Searching.htm">Orders</a> search, 
						which will list the orders under "Channel Orders" in the search 
					results. The Orders search is available through Order Management.</li>
            <li> The channel is responsible for product returns. Customers that purchase 
						your products through a channel should contact that channel if they need to 
						request refunds. To look up orders for returns, use the <a href="../Order_Management/Orders_Returning.htm">Returns</a> 
						search, which will specify when the channel should process the return. The 
					Returns search is available through Order Management.</li>
            <li>To monitor your channel sales activity, use the <a href="../Reports/Reports_SKUSalesbyDate.htm">SKU Sales by Date Range</a> report, which is available through Sales Reports. 
						This report allows you to find channel sales information without having to 
					log in to your SplitPay account. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How to accept a channel agreement</strong>
        </p>
        <p>If a channel submits an agreement for you to accept, the Channel List page 
					will display the channel name and a "Click to Accept Agreement" link. 
					Click that link to go to the Channel Agreement page, where you can review and 
				accept the agreement.</p>
        <p>Next, you will need to complete the Receipt &amp; Payment Information page. 
					See <a href="Channel_Default_Receipt.htm">Default Receipt Information</a> 
				and <a href="Channel_SplitPay.htm">SplitPay Account Information</a>.</p>
