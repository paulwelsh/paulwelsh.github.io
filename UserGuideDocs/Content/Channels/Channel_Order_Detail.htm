        <h2>Channel Order Detail</h2>
        <p>The Channel Order Detail page is accessible from the results of an <a href="../Order_Management/Orders_Searching.htm">Orders</a> 
			search. You can use the information on this page to provide product support 
		for channel orders, as in the following examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This page shows the number of activations for a given serial number. If 
				you need to manage the activations, you can click a link to go to the <a href="../Order_Management/Orders_Activation_Detail.htm">Activation Details</a> page.</li>
            <li>If a channel order includes one or more of your products that use the <a href="../SKU_Management/Serial_Pub.htm">"publisher e-mailed"</a> serial number option, you will receive an e-mail notification 
				that specifies the order number. When you look up the order, you can use information 
				such as registration name and customer e-mail address to provide the needed 
			serial numbers.</li>
            <li>To send an e-mail message to the customer, you can click the <span class="strong">E-mail</span> field.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> The channel is responsible for product returns. Customers that purchase 
			your products through a channel should contact that channel if they need to 
		request refunds.</p>
