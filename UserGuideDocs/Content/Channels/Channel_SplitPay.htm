        <h2>Channels: SplitPay Account Information</h2>
        <p>Before you can save changes to the Receipt &amp; Payment Information page and 
				submit SKUs to the channel, you need to enter your payment information. Your 
				share of the proceeds from the channel's sales will go to the  eSellerate SplitPay 
				account that you specify here. If you do not have a SplitPay account, you can 
				create one at <a href="http://splitpay.esellerate.net/" target="_blank">http://SplitPay.eSellerate.net</a>.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> As an  <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> publisher, you have the option to join the  
						eSellerate SplitPay program, which enables publishers to split the sales proceeds from 
						select SKUs with third parties. That program requires the third parties, or 
						payees, to set up their own SplitPay accounts and provide you with the account 
						IDs. In contrast, the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> Channels program requires you to set up a SplitPay 
						account and provide the channel with the account ID, because in this instance 
					you are the payee. (For more information on the SplitPay program, see <MadCap:xref href="../Other_Sales_Partnerships/Other_SplitPay.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Joining eSellerate SplitPay</MadCap:xref>.)</p>
