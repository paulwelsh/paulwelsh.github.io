            <o>Generating a Preview Certificate</o>
        </h2>
        <p>
            <o>The preview certificate (a number generated when you created your Embedded Web Store eSeller in the Sales Manager) allows you to test your application before shipping it. When you perform a purchase or check for update from your application and use the proper preview certificate number, the only information returned would be for preview SKUs assigned to this eSeller. Furthermore,  payment processing would execute in demo mode only, so no charges would occur. When you are ready to ship this application, just clear the preview certificate number, either from your source code or from the Sales Manager. The next time you perform a purchase or check for update, the information returned will be for active SKUs assigned to this eSeller, and the customers' payment methods will be billed.</o>
        </p>
        <p>
            <o>When you are finished testing your application and ready to ship, remember to clear out the preview certificate number from either your source code (this requires you to rebuild your application) or from the Sales Manager. Also, make sure that the SKUs assigned to your Embedded Web Store eSeller are correctly set to Active status.</o>
