        <p>Landing Pages are customized web pages that members of the eSellerate Affiliates program can use to promote your individual products. Information on how to make Landing Pages available to your affiliates follows.</p>
        <p>For information on the eSellerate Affiliates program, see <MadCap:xref MadCap:unresolvedLink="import-link:eSellerateAffiliates_945673464_67711" href="../eSellerate_Affiliates/Affiliates.htm" target="" title="" alt="">eSellerate Affiliates</MadCap:xref>.</p>

        <h4><a name="Prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites</h4>
        <p>Before you begin working with Landing Pages, you should have already done the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Signed up to use the  eSellerate Affiliates program </li>
            <li>Made at least one SKU available for affiliate sale </li>
            <li>Approved at least one affiliate for selling your products </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These actions are prerequisites for testing Landing Pages that you create.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Tip:</span> To see how your SKUs and Landing Pages are presented to affiliates, you can sign up for an affiliate management account at <a href="http://affiliates.esellerate.net/" target="_blank">http://affiliates.esellerate.net</a>. Having access to both types of accounts will allow you to test the affiliate process from end to end. For example, you could use the affiliate account to sign up to sell one of your own products, and then either approve or deny the request from your publisher account (assuming that you have manual approval enabled).</p>
        <h4><a name="TheBasics"></a>The Basics</h4>
        <p>Landing Pages offer affiliates a ready-made solution for providing product information and "Buy" and "Try" links. All that affiliates need to do is direct their customers to the Landing Page, where the customers can read about the product and then either purchase it or download an eST trial version (when trials are available). Because all promotion takes place on the Landing Page, there's no need for affiliates to list and update product information on their own.</p>
        <p>You can assign up to six Landing Pages to each of the SKUs that you make available for affiliate sale. If you assign multiple Landing Pages to a SKU, your affiliates will be able to choose the ones that best fit their needs.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" />provides an EZ Landing Page that you can assign to your SKUs without having to create and customize your own Landing Pages. For a look at a sample EZ Landing Page, visit <a href="http://publishers.esellerate.net/images/screenshot.jpg" target="_blank">http://publishers.esellerate.net/images/screenshot.jpg</a>. If you would like to use the EZ Landing Page option, and you do not intend to create and customize your own Landing Pages, you can skip to <MadCap:xref href="Layouts_LandingAssign.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Assigning Landing Pages to SKUs</MadCap:xref>.</p>
