        <h2>Another Capability – Code Blocks</h2>
        <p>In building out these localization features, we also added the capability of using <MadCap:keyword term="code blocks;localization:code blocks" />code blocks in store layouts.</p>
        <p>Strings in the lexicon can be as straightforward as a single word representing the Spanish translation for "Save", for instance. But for more advanced needs, they also can contain elements such as code blocks. For example, our localized responsive layouts use code blocks to handle payment methods. When we need to add payment methods or modify existing ones, we can push out the changes to those code blocks at any time, and your web stores will dynamically receive the updates, with no effort required on your part.</p>
        <p>The following illustrations are examples of how you can use a named string to hold a code block, and include the code block in your layout by referencing the string.</p>
