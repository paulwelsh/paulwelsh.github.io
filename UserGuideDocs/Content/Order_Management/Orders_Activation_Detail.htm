            <li>If an order involves serial numbers, its Order Detail page will include an Activation link for each serial number issued.</li>
            <li>The results of a Serial Number report will include a Serial Number link for each serial number found.</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <p>This page provides the following options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="strong">Increase Activations</span> – To increase the activations allowed for the order, enter the desired number in the <span class="strong">Increase Activations</span> field and then click <span class="strong">Save Changes</span>.</li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="strong">Blacklist Serial Number</span> – Use this function to disable all existing and future activations of products using the listed serial number. (Clicking <span class="strong">Save Changes</span> is not required.) You can later undo this blacklisting if needed.</p>
                <p>For serial numbers associated with a license file, the URL for downloading the license file will be nonfunctional while <span class="strong">Blacklist Serial Number</span> is enabled.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="strong">Uncheck to Deactivate</span> – In the Activation History, you can uncheck any or all activations for the order and then click <span class="strong">Update</span> to deactivate them. For reactivation, simply reverse the process.</li>
        </ul>
