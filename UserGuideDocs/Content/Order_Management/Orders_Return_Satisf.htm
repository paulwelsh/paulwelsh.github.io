        <h2>Satisfaction Refunds</h2>
        <p>Satisfaction Refunds allow you to refund a set dollar amount of the order without returning any items or canceling any subscriptions.</p>
        <h5>Notes</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>The amount available for refunding is the total cost of the line items minus coupons. It does not include shipping or taxes. </li>
            <li>A Satisfaction Refund prorates the refund amount across all order items.</li>
            <li>The return quantity for all items is always zero because no quantities are returned.</li>
            <li>Satisfaction Refunds do not affect SplitPay and <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> affiliate earnings. All other types of refunds (except tax-only ones) can require adjustments to SplitPay and affiliate earnings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For a Satisfaction Refund, you will need to complete the Verify Return Information page as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="strong">Return Date</span> – The return date will use the current date by default. You can change the date if desired.</li>
            <li><span class="strong">RMA&#160;Number</span> – If the return will use an RMA number, you can enter that number here (optional).</li>
            <li><span class="strong">Reason for Return</span> – Click this list to select a return reason. If you need to edit or create a return reason before you make your selection, click the <span class="strong">Edit Return Reasons</span> icon. When you're finished, you will need to navigate back to the Verify Return Information page.</li>
            <li><span class="strong">Comment</span> – Enter a comment (optional).</li>
            <li><span class="strong">Return E-mail Sender Address</span> – This field allows you to specify the "From" address for the notification e-mail that <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> will send to the customer when you finish processing this return. You can accept the default address, or enter a different one.</li>
            <li><span class="strong">Amount To Be Refunded</span>  – Enter the refund amount here. This must be greater than $0 and no more than the "Amount Available for Refund" value.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you're ready to proceed (there is no separate verification step with these refunds), click <span class="strong">Process The Return</span>. </p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note</span>: If the payment type for the order was international wire, you will have additional steps to complete at this time. See <MadCap:xref href="Orders_Returning.htm#ReturningWire" target="" title="" alt="">Returning International Wire Orders</MadCap:xref>. </p>
        <p>The Return Detail page will display a summary of the return. Be sure to note the Status field, which will indicate one of the following statuses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Processed</li>
            <li>Submitted</li>
            <li>Pending</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more information on these statuses, see <MadCap:xref href="Orders_Returning.htm#ProcessedVersus" target="" title="" alt="">Processed versus Submitted versus Pending Returns</MadCap:xref>.</p>
