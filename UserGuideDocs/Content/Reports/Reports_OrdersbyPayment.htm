        <h2>Orders by Payment Type</h2>
        <p>Use this report to see the payment types that your customers used on a specific date or over a date range. The results will break down the usage for all supported payment types and allow you to compare statistics such as the percentage of total transactions for each type.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> The earliest date that this report will return is 12/1/2005. The reason is that December 2005 was the first full month after <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> began accepting multiple payment types.</p>

        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> The credit card percentages in the Orders by Payment Type report account for all credit cards that <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> supports. PayPal percentages account for all PayPal payments, regardless of the funding source customers select when they authenticate their payments.</p>
