        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> Beginning on 4/26/2011, we have temporarily enabled estimated costing information (your profit and our commission) for our on-screen reports. This short-term change will allow us to complete some enhancements to Business Intelligence and Business Navigator reports.</p>

        <h5>To run a SplitPay Transaction Export:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the <span class="strong">Sales Reports</span> tab.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="strong">SplitPay Transaction Export</span>. The SplitPay Transaction Export page appears.<br /><img src="../Resources/Images/report_splitpay_transaction.jpg" class="PWimg" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" /></li>
            <li>This report can return results as a tab-delimited file or a comma-delimited file. Make your selection from the <span class="strong">Return Results As</span> list.</li>
            <li>Use the <span class="strong">Month</span>, <span class="strong">Day </span>and <span class="strong">Year </span>lists to specify the scope of your report.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="strong">Run</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>If you selected tab-delimited file results:</h5>
        <p>The resulting Save As dialog will display a default file name, which you can change if desired. In any case, you will need to change the file extension to ".txt" before saving the file (applies to both Windows and Macintosh platforms).</p>
        <p>You can now import the file into a database, or open it in a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel. (Because this is a basic text file, you may need to specify that the data is in tab-delimited format.)</p>
        <h5>If you selected comma-delimited file results:</h5>
        <p>The resulting Save As dialog will display a default file name, which you can change if desired. In any case, you will need to change the file extension to ".csv" before saving the file (applies to both Windows and Macintosh platforms).</p>
        <p>You can now import the file into a database, or open it in a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel. (If a program prompts you to specify a format for this data, select comma-delimited or comma-separated values.)</p>
