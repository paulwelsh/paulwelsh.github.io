        <p>eSellerate Product Activation is an option for protecting your software against casual software piracy. It allows you to limit the number of times a copy of your software can be activated—or made functional through serial number registration—on different computers.
</p>
        <h5>Notes on Product Activation
</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>You define activation limits through Product Activation sets.
</li>
            <li>The <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> Product Activation API requires use of the Product Activation Set ID, as found on the Product Activation Set Detail page.
</li>
            <li>You can deploy Product Activation Set IDs broadly—such as having one serial number activate a whole suite of products—or narrowly—such as forcing reactivation when updating to a newer version of an activated product.
</li>
            <li>Serial numbers used in Product Activation must be unique. Be sure to keep this restriction in mind when you choose serial number sets for activation purposes.
</li>
            <li>Product Activation associates a serial number with the unique hardware identification of the computer in use. After the initial activation, subsequent activations from the same computer will not increase the activation count for the serial number (provided there are no major changes to the hardware configuration). This behavior makes it possible for a product to reactivate/verify activation on a regular basis, without affecting the activation count.
</li>
            <li>When creating Product Activation sets, you may want to allow enough activations to accommodate users who frequently purchase new computers or make major changes to their hardware configurations.
</li>
            <li>Once you return a product, <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> will deny future activation attempts for that product. 
</li>
            <li>You may test Product Activation with eSellers running in preview mode.
</li>
