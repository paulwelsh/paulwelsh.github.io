        <h2>Export Compliance</h2>
        <p>The following information relates to the export compliance obligations for SKUs sold through eSellerate. Settings for specifying export compliance (such as "ECCN" and "Country of Origin") are available on the SKU&#160;Basic tab. </p>
        <h4>What are my obligations to DR in connection with export?</h4>
        <p>Under DR's standard reseller agreements, the publisher or manufacturer of Products resold by DR (whether purchased directly from that party or from a third party distributor) are required to provide DR with some or all of the following export-related codes and classifications related to their Products In order for DR to ensure it is in compliance with its export obligations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="strong">Export Control Classification Numbers</span>.  A client will need to provide an Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) for each Product resold by DR.  Every Product is designated or classified by the U.S. government for export purposes with an ECCN.  An ECCN is an alpha-numeric classification used in the Commerce Control List (CCL) to identify items for export control purposes.  A Product's ECCN classification is based on certain characteristics of that Product, including the nature of a Product, its functionality, and its capabilities.<br />A Product's ECCN is used by DR as part of its compliance process to determine if that Product can be exported, to which countries (other than embargoed and, in some cases, sanctioned countries) it can be exported, and whether there are any restrictions on the export to a particular country that would require an export license if a license exception is not available.</li>
            <li><span class="strong">Country of Origin</span>.  A client will also need to provide, for each Product, the country of origin for each Product.  Often referred to as the COO, the Country of Origin is the country in which the Product was manufactured or produced.  When shipping from one country to another, the COO is important as it helps DR to determine whether a Product can be exported to a particular country, and the duty rate.</li>
            <li><a name="schedulebhtscode"></a><span class="strong">Schedule B/HTS Code</span>.  A client will also need to provide, for each Product fulfilled physically, a Schedule B and Harmonized Tariff System ("HTS") code.  Schedule B codes are used by the Bureau of Census to collect trade statistics, and are different both from Harmonized Tariff System codes (which are used to determine import duties) and ECCNs (which are used to determine whether a product can be exported without a license).  By international agreement, most countries (including the US) recognize the same first 6 "harmonized" digits for HTS codes.  Schedule B codes are based on the international HTS system. HTS numbers and Schedule B numbers will be the same up to the first 6 digits as the importing country's classification code, after which, they will likely be very close or the same.</li>
            <li><a name="licenseexceptioncode"></a><span class="strong">License Exception Code</span>.   If a client's Product falls within a license exception (which means that DR can export that Product without a license), the client will need to provide the license exception code to DR in order for DR to be able to export that Product.</li>
            <li><a name="ccatscode"></a><span class="strong">CCATS Code</span>.  A Commodity Classification Automated Tracking System ("CCATS") code is an alpha-numeric code that is assigned by the US government once they have classified a Product according to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), and is also required for certain Products as some exports (including encryption Products) require post-shipment reporting to the US government, and the CCATS code is a mandatory element of these reports.</li>
        </ul>
