        <h5>Notes on setting NCP for coupons</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>The option of setting NCP is available for coupons with Preview status only. (You can edit coupons to change their status from Active to Preview as needed.)</li>
            <li>Once you save and activate a coupon, you will not be able to review its pricing configuration through the Coupon tab. However, you can use the Coupons by Currency pricing report for that purpose.</li>
            <li>For each currency listed on the Coupon tab, you can set the minimum order amount, and in some instances, the discount. You cannot edit percentage discounts, or discounts that provide free shipping.</li>
            <li>Make sure that your coupon discounts do not result in order totals that are greater than $0 and less than $1 USD. Because payment processors cannot process transactions for amounts less than $1, a coupon discount that reduces the order total to less than $1 will force <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> to provide the product for free. Publishers accept complete responsibility for the setup and implementation of their coupons to prevent this occurrence.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>To set NCP for coupons:</h5>
