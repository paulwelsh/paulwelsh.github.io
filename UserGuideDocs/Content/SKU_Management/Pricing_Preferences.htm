        <h5>Notes on Pricing Preferences</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Unchecking a currency in Pricing Preferences does not remove NCP amounts that are already set up for that currency. To remove NCP amounts, you will first need to make sure the required currencies are checked in Pricing Preferences. Then go to the Pricing tabs and clear the NCP amounts from their respective fields. Be sure to save your changes.</li>
            <li>As an alternative to clicking through the Pricing tabs to review your configurations, you can use the following pricing reports:<ul><li>SKU Pricing by Currency</li><li>Volume Discount by Currency</li><li>Cross-Sell Discount by Currency</li><li>Coupons by Currency</li><li>Up-Sell Discount by Currency</li></ul></li>
            <li>Internet Explorer users: To allow the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> Sales Manager to save your pricing preferences, the "Check for newer versions of stored pages" setting must be set to something other than "Never." A typical way to access this setting is as follows:<ol><li>In Internet Explorer, click the <span class="strong">Tools </span>menu and select <span class="strong">Internet Options</span>.</li><li>On the <span class="strong">General </span>tab, click <span class="strong">Settings</span>.</li></ol></li>
        </ul>
        <h5>To set your preferences for NCP:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the <span class="strong">Pricing </span>tab. The Pricing page appears.</li>
            <li>Click the <span class="strong">Preferences </span>tab. The Pricing Preferences appear.<br /><img src="../Resources/Images/sku_pref.jpg" class="PWimg" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" /></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Currencies that you check in the Pricing Preferences dialog box will be available on the various Pricing tabs for setting NCP. (The base currency, USD, is always available.) By showing only the currencies that you currently need, you can simplify the user interfaces and make it easier to review and set NCP.</p>
        <p>To set your pricing preferences, check the currencies that you want to use for setting NCP, and then click <span class="strong">Save</span>.</p>
