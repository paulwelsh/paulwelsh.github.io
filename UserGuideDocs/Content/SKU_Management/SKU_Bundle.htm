            <MadCap:keyword term="SKUs:setting up as bundles;bundles:setting up SKUs as" />Setting Up the SKU as a Bundle (Optional)</h2>
        <p>You can use this feature to sell a collection of SKUs as a bundle. Detailed information on bundles is available at <MadCap:xref href="Bundle_Overview.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Bundle Overview</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h5>Notes</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>A bundle is a parent SKU that contains child SKUs.</li>
            <li>You can set a property such as terms of sale at the bundle/parent SKU level, which then applies to the entire bundle, or you can allow each child SKU to set the property separately.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>To set up this SKU as a bundle:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>From the SKU Detail page, click the <span class="strong">Bundle </span>tab. The SKU's Bundle properties appear.<br /><img src="../Resources/Images/sku_bundle.jpg" class="PWimg" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" /></li>
            <li>When the number of available SKUs exceeds a certain number, some SKUs will be hidden. If the SKUs that you want to add to the bundle are not showing, use any of the following methods to find them:<ul><li>To see all the available SKUs, click <span class="strong">Show All (X SKUs)</span>.</li><li>You can search for a SKU by entering all or part of its name. The name search is case-insensitive.</li><li>If your account includes multiple SKU categories (and there are SKUs set up to use them), there will be an option to search by category. (You can create categories for SKUs and Web Store/Embedded Web Store eSellers at Home &gt; Categories.)</li></ul></li>
            <li>
                <p>Select the check box for each SKU that you want the bundle to contain.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> To control the order in which child SKUs appear in receipts and order confirmations, add the SKUs to the bundle one at a time in the required order. (You can see the current ordering in the Child SKUs list.) To make adjustments to an existing bundle, remove the SKUs that are out of order, and then add them back in one at a time in the required order.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Click <span class="strong">Add</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once you add at least one SKU to create the bundle, the information near the top of the page disappears, and selections for these properties appear: <span class="strong">Delivery Method</span>, <span class="strong">eCD File</span>, <span class="strong">eCD Layout</span>, <span class="strong">SKU Download</span>, <span class="strong">Serial Number</span>, <span class="strong">Terms of Sale</span>, <span class="strong">Subscription</span>, <span class="strong">eCD Delivery Frequency</span> and <span class="strong">Order E-mail and Receipt Text</span>.</p>
        <p>If you want one of these properties to be the same for the entire bundle, you can set it at the bundle level. Otherwise, you can allow each child SKU to set the property separately.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>
                <p>You can use the <span class="strong">Delivery Method</span> list to determine whether eCD (CD fulfillment) is optional, or included with the specified SKUs. Your choices are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="strong">Download Only (eCD Optional)</span> – A single delivery method will apply to the entire bundle. When customers purchase the bundle, they will have the option of receiving copies of their software purchases on a CD (provided that you also select an eCD file), in addition to downloading them from your web store.</li>
                    <li><span class="strong">Specified in Each Child SKU</span> – Each child SKU will use the delivery method specified for it on the Advanced tab of the SKU Detail page. When customers purchase the bundle, eCD will be optional, included, or both, depending on the settings of the child SKUs. (Selecting this option also sets the bundle's <span class="strong">eCD File</span> and <span class="strong">eCD Layout</span> lists to <span class="strong">Specified in Each Child SKU</span>.)</li>
                    <li><span class="strong">Download and eCD</span> – A single delivery method will apply to the entire bundle. When customers purchase the bundle, they will receive one or more CDs, and downloads will be made available to them.</li>
                    <li><span class="strong">eCD Only</span> – A single delivery method will apply to the entire bundle. When customers purchase the bundle, they will receive one or more CDs. No downloads will be made available to them in regard to the bundle.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Caution:</span> Please carefully review your production costs for the <span class="strong">Download and eCD</span> and <span class="strong">eCD Only</span> delivery methods. See "eCD Included" on the eCD Configuration tab.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The <span class="strong">eCD File</span> list determines the files that are written to CD to represent the specified SKUs when customers purchase eCD. Your choices are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="strong">None</span> – Neither the bundle nor the child SKUs will use eCD files. This option is available only with the <span class="strong">Download Only (eCD Optional)</span> delivery method.</li>
                    <li><span class="strong">Specified in Each Child SKU</span> – Each child SKU will use the eCD file specified for it on the Advanced tab of the SKU Detail page. When customers purchase the bundle, they will receive a separate file on CD&#160;for each child SKU that uses that option.</li>
                    <li><span class="strong">&lt;eCD File&gt;</span> – A single eCD file will apply to the entire bundle. When customers purchase the bundle, they will receive one file on CD.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you need to edit or create an eCD file (download) before you make your selection, click <span class="strong">Save</span>, and then click the <span class="strong">Edit Downloads</span> icon.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can use eCD Layouts to control certain attributes of CDs that are delivered to your customers. Some examples are the Mailer Type (Standard Mailer, Custom Mailer or DVD Case) and the CD Face Image.</p>
                <p>To select a layout, use the <span class="strong">eCD Layouts</span> list. Your choices are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><span class="strong">Default eCD Layout</span> – A single eCD layout will apply to the entire bundle. When customers purchase the bundle, all CDs that they receive for eCD will use the default layout. </p>
                        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:&#160;</span>This option includes a Standard Mailer, a default image for the CD face, a basic Install Menu, and no trial files.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="strong">Specified in Each Child SKU</span> – Each child SKU will use the eCD layout specified for it on the Advanced tab of the SKU Detail page. When customers purchase the bundle, the CDs that they receive for eCD may use a variety of layouts, depending on the settings of the child SKUs.</li>
                    <li><span class="strong">&lt;eCD Layout&gt;</span> – A single eCD layout will apply to the entire bundle. When customers purchase the bundle, all CDs that they receive for eCD will use the same layout.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you need to edit or create a layout before you make your selection, click <span class="strong">Save</span>, and then click the <span class="strong">Edit eCD Layouts</span> icon.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can use the <span class="strong">SKU Download</span> list to specify the file that <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> should make available for downloading when it delivers one of your SKUs. (You can also override SKU download settings with individual eSellers.) Your choices are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="strong">None</span> – Neither the bundle nor the child SKUs will use downloads.</li>
                    <li><span class="strong">Specified in Each Child SKU</span> – Each child SKU will use the download file specified for it on the Basic tab of the SKU Detail page. When customers purchase the bundle, they will download a separate file for each child SKU that uses that option.</li>
                    <li><span class="strong">&lt;SKU Download&gt;</span> – A single download file will apply to the entire bundle. When customers purchase the bundle, they will download one file.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you need to edit or create a download file before you make your selection, click <span class="strong">Save</span>, and then click the <span class="strong">Edit Downloads</span> icon.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> To delete a download file, use the Downloads editor (available in the References section of the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> Sales Manager).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you assign serial number sets to your SKUs, <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> will issue serial numbers for the SKUs when they are purchased. You can then implement the serial numbers any way you choose. Typical uses include registering products and protecting products against software piracy.</p>
                <p>To select a serial number set, use the <span class="strong">Serial Number</span> list. Your choices are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="strong">None</span> – Neither the bundle nor the child SKUs will use serial numbers.</li>
                    <li><span class="strong">Specified in Each Child SKU</span> – Each child SKU will use the serial number set specified for it on the Basic tab of the SKU Detail page. When customers purchase the bundle, <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> will issue a separate serial number for each child SKU that uses that option.</li>
                    <li><span class="strong">&lt;Serial Number Set&gt;</span> – A single serial number set will apply to the entire bundle. When customers purchase the bundle, <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> will issue one serial number. (This example assumes a quantity of one.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you need to edit or create a serial number set before you make your selection, click <span class="strong">Save</span>, and then click the <span class="strong">Edit Serial Numbers</span> icon.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can use the <span class="strong">Terms of Sale</span> list to specify terms that the customer must agree to before purchasing one of your SKUs. Your choices are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="strong">None</span> – Neither the bundle nor the child SKUs will use terms of sale.</li>
                    <li><span class="strong">Specified in Each Child SKU</span> – Each child SKU will use the terms of sale specified for it on the Advanced tab of the SKU Detail page. When customers purchase the bundle, they will need to agree to one consolidated list that includes the terms of sale for each child SKU that uses that option.</li>
                    <li><span class="strong">&lt;Terms of Sale&gt;</span> – A single set of terms will apply to the entire bundle. When customers purchase the bundle, they will need to agree to one set of terms.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you need to edit or create a terms of sale item before you make your selection, click <span class="strong">Save</span>, and then click the <span class="strong">Edit Terms of Sale</span> icon.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The subscription option applies to SKUs that you want to sell through a subscription model.</p>
                <p>To select a subscription method, use the <span class="strong">Subscriptions </span>list. Your choices are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="strong">None </span>– Neither the bundle nor the child SKUs will use subscriptions.</li>
                    <li><span class="strong">Specified in Each Child SKU</span> – Each child SKU will use the subscription specified for it on the Advanced tab of the SKU Detail page. When customers purchase the bundle, they will start a separate subscription for each child SKU that uses that option. The customers will need to agree to one consolidated list that includes the subscription terms and conditions for each subscription.</li>
                    <li><span class="strong">&lt;Subscription&gt;</span> – A single subscription will apply to the entire bundle. When customers purchase the bundle, they will start one subscription, which will be associated with the bundle's SKU name and SKU ID. The customers will need to agree to one set of subscription terms and conditions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you need to edit or create a subscription method before you make your selection, click <span class="strong">Save</span>, and then click the <span class="strong">Edit Subscriptions</span> icon.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When you sell this SKU through a subscription model (with eCD included), you can determine the delivery frequency for eCD. There will always be a CD delivered with the initial order (the default setting), but you can also choose to have it delivered at additional times in the subscription period, including renewals and recurring billings.</p>
                <p>Use the <span class="strong">eCD Delivery Frequency</span> list to make your selection.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Caution:</span> You will have additional eCD costs with subscriptions if <span class="strong">eCD Delivery Frequency</span> is set to anything other than <span class="strong">Only Initial Order</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The <span class="strong">Order E-mail and Receipt Text</span> field is for entering text to accompany a SKU's information in the following customer communications: Order Confirmation e-mail (sent to your customer immediately after the purchase), Order Fulfillment e-mail (sent to your customer when you fulfill the order) and the receipt displayed at the conclusion of a Web Store or Embedded Web Store purchase. This enables you to provide your customers with information specific to each SKU in their order.</p>
                <p>Like the other properties noted here, you can specify Order E-mail and Receipt Text at the bundle level, or the child SKU level. The differences are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="strong">Bundle level:</span> As you add SKUs to the bundle, their Order E-mail and Receipt Text is copied to the bundle's Order E-mail and Receipt Text field. You can edit the copied text and add information about the bundle if desired. (Text that is copied to the bundle's Order E-mail and Receipt Text field is not dynamic, so you will need to update it when you make changes such as removing SKUs from the bundle.) When customers purchase the bundle, order e-mails and receipts will show one block of Order E-mail and Receipt Text.</li>
                    <li><span class="strong">Child SKU level:</span> If you clear all text from the bundle's Order E-mail and Receipt Text field, the Order E-mail and Receipt Text from the child SKUs will apply. When customers purchase the bundle, order e-mails and receipts will show separate blocks of Order E-mail and Receipt Text for each child SKU that uses that option. There will not be an entry for the bundle itself.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For SKUs you offer through Web Store and Embedded Web Store eSellers, the Order E-mail and Receipt Text field will accept any of the valid HTML tags listed at <a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/html_cheatsheet/" target="_blank">http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/html_cheatsheet/</a>.</p>
                <p>In addition, the HTML representations listed under "Name Code" and "Number Code" at <a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/special_characters/" target="_blank">http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/special_characters/</a> are valid anywhere the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> system supports HTML.</p>
                <p>For related e-mail customization features, see <MadCap:xref href="../Account_Management/Account_Receipt.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Entering Default Receipt Information</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Click <span class="strong">Save</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When you finish setting up the bundle, you can add it to one or more eSellers. Be sure to add all of the child SKUs to the eSellers, as well. If you don't want a child SKU to be available as an individual item in the eSeller, set the SKU's status to Hidden.</p>
        <p>You can add SKUs to eSellers and set SKU statuses on the Usage tab of the SKU Detail page. See <MadCap:xref href="SKU_eSellers.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Adding the SKU to Web Store or Embedded Web Store eSellers</MadCap:xref>.</p>
