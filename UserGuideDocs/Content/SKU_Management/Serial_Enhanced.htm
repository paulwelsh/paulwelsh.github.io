            <MadCap:keyword term="serial numbers:Ready-to-Use:Standard Enhanced" />Standard Enhanced</h2>
        <p>The Standard Enhanced option provides strongly encrypted serial numbers whose validator is available through our SDK.<br /><img src="../Resources/Images/ready_enhanced.jpg" class="PWimg" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" /></p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> Your application can check the validity of a Standard Enhanced serial number through an API call to ValidateSerialNumber. For more information about this API function, see  the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> SDK Reference.</p>
        <p class="pwNote" MadCap:conditions="Primary.ExcludeFromAllBuilds"><span class="strong">Note:</span> We recommend a two-part approach for enforcing your licensing rules with Standard Enhanced serial numbers:<br /><br />* To verify that a Standard Enhanced serial number meets all the criteria for its associated serial number set, your application can use an API call to ValidateSerialNumber. The validator and API instructions are available for downloading through the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> Downloads page. <br /><br />* To periodically verify that a Standard Enhanced serial number is still valid—the associated order item has not been returned, for instance—your application can make a call to the Order Lookup Web Service. Resources to help you implement the Order Lookup Web Service are included with our XML Resources download. (See <MadCap:xref href="../Account_Management/Account_XML.htm#preparingtouse" target="" title="" alt="">Preparing to Use the XML Data</MadCap:xref>.)<br /></p>
        <p>For reference purposes, an example of a Standard Enhanced serial number that includes a prefix and the purchase quantity follows:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/StandardEnhanced.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> For the key portion of a Standard Enhanced serial number, <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> does not use the letters I, O, U or Z because they can be easily confused with other characters. To accommodate customers who mistakenly enter these letters in Standard Enhanced serial numbers, the validation function (an API call to ValidateSerialNumber) will substitute the number 1 for I, the number 0 for O, the letter V for U and the number 2 for Z. The function also will substitute uppercase characters for lowercase ones.</p>
        <h5>To create a Standard Enhanced serial number set:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>From the <span class="strong">Ready-to-Use Type</span> list, select <span class="strong">Standard Enhanced</span>.</li>
            <li>In the <span class="strong">Prefix </span>field, enter a prefix that will help you quickly identify this serial number set (optional). You can use any alphanumeric characters, except for colons (:). The length can be 0-24 characters.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Your serial number generation can be based on any of the following:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>None</li>
                    <li>The customer's first and last name</li>
                    <li>The company name</li>
                    <li>Some special data (Prompted Data) that the customer is required to enter</li>
                </ul>
                <p> Make your selection from the <span class="strong">Based On</span> list.</p>
                <p>See also <MadCap:xref href="#extradataoption" target="" title="" alt="">The Extra Data Option</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>With the Prompted Data feature, you can use prompts to base your serial number generation on customer input. If you enable this feature, your <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> web stores (standard and embedded) will prompt customers to enter specific information as part of the purchase process.</p>
                <p>From the <span class="strong">Prompt For</span> list, select the information your web stores should require for SKUs that use this serial number set. Your choices are as follows:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>None</li>
                    <li>RegCode</li>
                    <li>Palm OS® HotSync Name</li>
                    <li>Pocket PC Owner Name</li>
                    <li>(Custom Prompt)</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> When appropriate, online help will be available to show your customers how to locate handheld device information such as RegCode.</p>
            </li>
            <li>The <span class="strong">Custom Prompt</span> field appears/applies only when you select the "(Custom Prompt)" option in the Prompt For list. Text that you enter here (up to 50 characters) will define the prompt displayed to your customers. For example, if you enter "Nickname" in the Custom Prompt field, your web store will display "<span class="strong">Nickname:</span> [input field]" when that information is required for a SKU purchase.</li>
            <li>In the <span class="strong">Duration </span>field, enter the number of days that the serial number will be functional (optional). This setting causes serial numbers to contain the date of expiration, which you can find with the validation function. You can then use the date of expiration to limit customer usage of your demo software or shareware.</li>
            <li>If you select the <span class="strong">Use Quantity</span> check box, the serial numbers will indicate the quantity purchased. (Multiple quantity sales require a special setting at the SKU level. See <MadCap:xref href="SKU_Advanced.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Setting the SKU's Advanced Properties (Optional)</MadCap:xref>.)</li>
            <li>
                <p>In addition to providing strongly encrypted serial numbers, the Standard Enhanced option provides the means to generate license files for use with the AquaticPrime framework. You can learn about AquaticPrime license files at <a href="http://www.aquaticmac.com/" target="_blank">http://www.aquaticmac.com/</a>. Notes on using license files with <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> are available at <MadCap:xref href="Serial_Aquatic.htm" target="" title="" alt="">AquaticPrime License Files</MadCap:xref>.</p>
                <p>If you do not need to generate a license file, you can accept the default setting for <span class="strong">Delivery Method</span> (<span class="strong">Serial Number</span>), save your changes, and then skip to <MadCap:xref href="#extradataoption" target="" title="" alt="">The Extra Data Option</MadCap:xref>. Otherwise, you can choose one of the following options for generating a license file:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li><span class="strong">License File</span> – Order receipts and confirmation e-mails will provide a link to the license file. (The serial number is generated as usual, but not shown to customers.)</li>
                    <li><span class="strong">Serial Number &amp; License File</span> – Order receipts and confirmation e-mails will list the serial number and provide a link to the license file.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/ready_enhanced_2.jpg" class="PWimg" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The <span class="strong">File Name</span> field determines the name of the generated license files. The default value (&lt;SkuName&gt;.plist) consists of the SKU name variable (stripped of HTML and non-alphanumeric characters) and a .plist extension. Spaces are replaced with underscores.</p>
                <p>You can override the default value with variable or static values, and any file extension.</p>
                <p>The static values can be up to 256 characters and are not restricted to alphanumeric. No character stripping or variable substitution occurs for static values, and they do not need to be enclosed in brackets.</p>
                <p>You can use any of the following variable values for the file name:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>SkuName</li>
                    <li>SerialNumber</li>
                    <li>SKUID</li>
                    <li>OrderID</li>
                    <li>BillingName (<i>first and last combined</i>)</li>
                    <li>RegistrationName (<i>first and last combined</i>)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Variables must be enclosed in brackets, and can be combined in any order to form the file name, as in the following example:</p>
                <p>&lt;SKUName&gt;_&lt;BillingName&gt;.plist</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When you select the license file option, the editor generates a key pair to fill in the <span class="strong">File Public Key</span> and <span class="strong">File Private Key</span> fields. You can copy the key pair for use with your client Aquatic Prime validation.</p>
                <p>If you need to mimic your client AquaticPrime generation and verification, you can paste existing key pairs into the File Public Key and File Private Key fields. The editor will validate the key pair when you save the serial number set. If the key pair is invalid, you will have the option to correct it, or click a button to generate a new key pair.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Generated license files always include a signature, and can optionally include a number of additional items such as date, quantity and registration name.You can select the additional items in the options under <span class="strong">File Content</span>, <span class="strong">Use </span>and <span class="strong">Name</span>.</p>
                <p>To include an item in the license files, select its <span class="strong">Use </span>check box. (None of the items are required.)</p>
                <p>The <span class="strong">Name </span>value determines the name for the item's name-value pair in the license files. You can enter a new name (up to 50 characters) to override the default one for the item, if desired.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> If you override text for a <span class="strong">Name </span>value, you must also select the <span class="strong">Use </span>check box for the corresponding item. If you do not do this, your changes will not be applied when you save the serial number set.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> Two items—Billing Address and Shipping Address—do not provide a name override because selecting either of them causes the license files to include multiple data fields for the complete value.</p>
                <p>In addition to being able to include variable values, you can specify a static value to be included in all the license files. To use this option, select the <span class="strong">Use </span>check box for <span class="strong">Static Data</span>, and then enter a value in the <span class="strong">Static Data Value</span> field. There are no character or size restrictions on this value.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Click <span class="strong">Save Changes</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4><a name="extradataoption"></a>The Extra Data Option</h4>
        <p>In addition to the Based On settings for the serial number set, you have the option to base your Standard Enhanced serial numbers on dynamic information (such as user input or machine ID) sent by your application. In this case, your application would use a special parameter (extraData) to pass the information to the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> servers during an API call to Purchase or CheckForUpdate. This may be any kind and amount of information you choose, as long as it's packaged as a single string.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note</span>:&#160;There is nothing that you need to enable in a Standard Enhanced serial number set to allow it to work with the Extra Data option. <br /><br />You can use the Extra Data option in conjunction with the Based On options, or on its own (with <span class="strong">Based On</span> set to <span class="strong">None</span>). </p>
        <p>For more information about these API functions and the extraData parameter, see  the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> SDK Reference.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> You can also manually generate a serial number. See <MadCap:xref href="Serial_Manual.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Manually Generating Serial Numbers</MadCap:xref>.</p>
