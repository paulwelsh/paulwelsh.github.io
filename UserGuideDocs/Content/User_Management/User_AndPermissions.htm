        <p>The permissions manager allows multiple users with varying levels of permissions to manage the same account.</p>
        <h5>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Users &amp; Permissions:permissions manager" />Notes on the Permissions Manager</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Permissions can be granted for any of the main functional areas shown on the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> Sales Manager home page. </li>
            <li>Permissions allow the user to access all the primary functions of an area. For example, a user with permissions for the "Sales Reports" area can access all of the sales reports. </li>
            <li>Areas that the logged-in user cannot access appear dimmed. </li>
            <li>If the user tries to navigate to an area that requires additional permissions, the page will display the following message: "You do not have access to this area of the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> Sales Manager. If you think you should have access to this area, please ask one of the following people to change your permissions." The listing below this message will include the names and e-mail addresses of users who have user management permissions for the account.</li>
            <li>Once an account is set up to use the permissions manager, there are two primary roles for the users: <ul><li><MadCap:keyword term="Users &amp; Permissions:account administrator" />Account administrator — There is one administrator for each account. The administrator has access to all areas of the Sales Manager, and therefore can manage the permissions of all other users. </li><li><MadCap:keyword term="Users &amp; Permissions:authorized users" />Authorized users — This group includes all users other than the administrator who have their own login credentials for accessing the account. Each authorized user has a set level of permissions, which can range from no permissions to full access like the administrator. </li></ul></li>
            <li>The permissions manager does not include the administrator in the list of users, because the administrator's permissions cannot be modified.</li>
            <li>Users with user management permissions can manage their own permissions, and those of all other users except the administrator. Other options available to these users include adding and deleting user accounts, resetting passwords and changing login credentials. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        <p>To set up an account to use the permissions manager, the administrator will need to do the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to the User Management section on the home page of the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> Sales Manager and click <span class="strong">About Users &amp; Permissions</span>. (This link will change after you specify a company ID.) The page that appears will provide information on the benefits of this option. When you finish reading the information, click <span class="strong">Continue</span>. You will then be able to continue with step 2.</li>
            <li>Create a company ID. See <MadCap:xref href="User_CompanyID.htm#UserManagement_3551172818_261076" target="" title="" alt="">Login Company ID</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>Add authorized users. See <MadCap:xref href="User_List.htm" target="" title="" alt="">User List</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>Set each users' login credentials and permissions. See <MadCap:xref href="User_Detail.htm#UserManagement_3551172818_268623" target="" title="" alt="">User Detail</MadCap:xref>.</li>
        </ol>
