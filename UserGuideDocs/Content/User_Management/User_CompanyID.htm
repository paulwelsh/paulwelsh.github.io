        <p>If you want this account to use the permissions manager, the first step is to specify a company ID. From then on, all users who log in to this account will need to enter the company ID, in addition to their own login name and password.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Caution:</span> You will not be able to edit or delete your company ID after you create it.<br /></p>
        <p>To enable this account to use the permissions manager, enter an ID of up to 50 characters, and then click <span class="strong">Save Company ID</span>. The Users page appears. See <MadCap:xref href="User_List.htm#UserManagement_3551172818_268616" target="" title="" alt="">User List</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>If you do not want this account to use the permissions manager, click <span class="strong">Cancel</span>. You will then be able to continue logging in as usual, without having to enter a company ID.</p>
