        <h2>Web Store: Links</h2>
        <p>The following information applies to the Web Store Links section of the Web Store eSeller Summary page.  <br /><img src="../Resources/Images/web_links.jpg" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" class="PWimg" /></p>
        <h4>Active URL, Preview URL</h4>
        <p>For each web store you create, you are provided an Active URL and Preview URL link. The Active URL is a public link to your web store. This link is for use in your company web site and marketing materials. The Preview URL is for internal testing purposes only. This allows you to set up and test SKUs in Preview mode before making the changes available in your public web site.</p>
        <p>You set a SKU's status (Active, Preview, both or neither) within its respective eSeller dialog. This enables a SKU to have an individual status for each eSeller that uses it. In Web Store SKUs, these settings are at Home &gt; eSeller Lists &gt; Web Store eSeller Summary &gt; Web Store SKU attributes. </p>
        <h4>More URLs</h4>
        <p>For a listing of direct links to various locations in this web store, click the link next to More URLs. You can copy any of the displayed links to use on your company web site and/or distribute to your sales partners.</p>
