        <h2><a name="kanchor107"></a>SeeWhy Configuration</h2>
        <p>SeeWhy is a service that helps convert online shopping cart abandoners to paying customers.   It uses an e-mail campaign to remind visitors that their shopping cart contents are still available. This can involve up to three e-mails, beginning with one about 20 minutes after cart abandonment and continuing with one after 23 hours and another after seven days. The purpose of these messages is to act as a reminder of the product and the site, but they also place an emphasis on service, so that visitors know they can get help if something went wrong with the order process. </p>
        <p>The e-mail campaign ends when the visitor returns to the cart and completes a purchase, or when all of the mailings have gone out. </p>
        <h3>How SeeWhy Integrates with eSellerate</h3>
        <p>SeeWhy is supported for Web Store eSellers only.</p>
        <p>If you enable SeeWhy service for your eSellerate account, SeeWhy will send optimized e-mails to shopping cart abandoners on your behalf. Everything from the sender address, to support information, to SKU images and descriptions, will be specific to your company.</p>
        <h3>Campaign Overview</h3>
        <p>When a visitor shows intent to purchase by adding one or more products to the shopping cart, a countdown begins. The timer resets each time the visitor does something that indicates activity on the page. Once 21 minutes have passed with no activity, the cart is considered abandoned, at which time the first e-mail is sent. </p>
        <p data-mc-conditions="Primary.Online">Click the image below to see a sample of the first e-mail.</p>
        <table style="width: 100%;" data-mc-conditions="Primary.Online">
            <col />

                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>After 23 hours, if the visitor has not yet returned and made a purchase, a second e-mail is sent. There are two possible versions of this e-mail. You determine the version with the "Include Return Text" setting under SeeWhy Integration. </p>

        <p>Seven days after the first e-mail was sent, if the visitor has not yet returned and made a purchase, a third and final e-mail is sent. There are two possible versions of this e-mail. You determine the version with the "Offer Discount" setting under SeeWhy Integration. </p>

        <h3>Configuring SeeWhy Integration for Your Account</h3>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">In the Advanced Sales Options section of the Sales Manager, click <span class="strong">Third-Party Integration</span>. </li>
            <li value="2">In the upper right corner of the SeeWhy Configuration section, click  the plus icon. The configuration options appear.<br /></li>
            <li value="3">You can turn the SeeWhy service on or off for your eSellerate account by making a selection from the <span class="strong">Status </span>list. If you want all of your stores to use the SeeWhy service, select <span class="strong">Enabled</span>. If you do not want your stores to use the SeeWhy service at this time, select <span class="strong">Disabled</span> from the <span class="strong">Status </span>list, and then skip to the last step here (saving changes).</li>
            <li value="4"> One way to help entice customers is to emphasize that purchases are low risk, because you allow returns. If you select the <span class="strong">Include Return Text</span> check box, the second mailing will promote "zero hassle refunds for 30 days." You should only enable this option if you are willing to honor refund requests on all your products for 30 days after the sale. If you do not enable this option, the second mailing will state, "We've kept your cart for you."</li>
            <li value="5">If you choose, the third and final mailing sent to your visitors can offer a discount of anything from 1 to 99 percent off the total purchase. To enable this option, select the <span class="strong">Offer Discount</span> check box. If you do not enable this option, the third and final mailing will state, "Your shopping cart expires shortly."</li>
            <li value="6">If you enabled the offer discount in the preceding step, enter a whole number between 1 and 99 in the <span class="strong">Discount Percentage</span> field.</li>
            <li value="7">By default, your SeeWhy mailings will include an eSellerate header logo. If you would like to use your own logo instead, you can upload an image here. The logo must be 585 pixels wide, and one of the following types: PNG, JPG, GIF or BMP. To upload a logo, click <span class="strong">Browse</span>, and then select the desired image.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol data-mc-continue="true">
            <li value="8">The remaining fields for SeeWhy configuration determine the contact information that SeeWhy mailings will show for your company. For example, the mailings will show the company name specified in the <span class="strong">Company Name</span> field, and will be sent from the address specified in the <span class="strong">E-Mail From Address</span> field.    
<br /><br />For your convenience, eSellerate fills in these fields with your data from the Receipt Information page. You can make changes if needed, or leave the current entries in place.
</li>
            <li value="9">Click <span class="strong">Save Changes</span>.</li>
