        <h1>Localization Overview</h1>
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p><span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span> provides the capability for publishers to localize their web stores for multiple languages (listed below). Once in the web store, customers choose their desired language from a pull-down menu that lists each language in its localized form—German appears as "Deutsch", for example.  The text on new store layouts is localized in all supported languages. Publishers can customize most text and translations, or take them as they are, ready to go. Publishers also have the ability to localize their own product and web store elements, for things like SKU name and description, terms of sale, and store name. Localized web stores are available when using Custom or Standard Layouts that have been updated to support localization.</p>
        <h4>Scope</h4>
        <p>The scope of these localization capabilities extends only to customer-facing language. There have been no changes for publisher-facing language, which is in English only.</p>
        <h4>Supported Languages</h4>
        <p>The supported languages for localization are English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese Simplified, and Chinese Traditional.</p>
        <h4>Other Localized Sites and Communications</h4>
        <p>In addition to web stores as previously noted, the customer-facing After-Purchase Services web site (<a href="http://store.esellerate.net/support" target="_blank">http://store.esellerate.net/support</a>) is localized. The entry page for this site is in English, but when customers log in to see their orders, the results are shown in the language used for the order.</p>
        <p>E-mails sent to customers are localized in the language used for the order. Some examples of these e-mails are order confirmations and subscription renewal reminders.</p>
        <h4>More Details</h4>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">The base language of the eSellerate system is English. All text entered as part of the typical setup—such as filling out the SKU Detail tab—must be in English. For the items that are localizable, publishers can go to the Translation and Lexicon pages to enter non-English text as needed.</li>
            <li value="2">	Duplicating an item such as a SKU or an eSeller does not copy translations. Publishers will need to manually add translations after duplicating the items. This could involve copying and pasting within the Sales Manager, or working with exported Excel files.</li>
        </ul>
