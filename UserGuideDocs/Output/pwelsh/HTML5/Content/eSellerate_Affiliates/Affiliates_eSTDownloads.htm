        <h2><a name="kanchor112"></a>Creating eST Downloads</h2>
        <p>Along with displaying "Buy" links for your product, your affiliates can also earn commission by providing a trial version that will enable users to later purchase the product (Windows systems only). Some benefits of this method are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Users who are undecided about a purchase can try before they buy. </li>
            <li value="2">When users are ready to buy, integrated purchase features make it easy. </li>
            <li value="3">The eSellerate SalesTrac Technology (eST) used to package the product ensures that your affiliate receives credit for the sale. This creates incentive for affiliates to offer "Try" links for your product, and thereby extend your sales opportunities.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="eSellerateAffiliates_686029767_88328"></a><a name="eSellerateAffiliates_686029767_27426"></a>About eST</h3>
        <p>The basics of this feature are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">You create a single Windows executable file (typically an installer) that delivers an <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span>-powered product with try and buy functionality.</li>
            <li value="2">You upload the file to the <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span> servers.</li>
            <li value="3">When one of your affiliates elects to sell your product through the eST option, <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span> dynamically customizes the file for use by that affiliate. </li>
            <li value="4">The affiliate downloads its customized file and hosts the file on its web site. </li>
            <li value="5">A user downloads the file through the affiliate site.</li>
            <li value="6">When launched, the file writes affiliate information to the Windows registry.</li>
            <li value="7">When the user later buys the product using its integrated purchase features, registry information is used to credit the affiliate for the sale.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> As a backup to the primary tracking method (writing affiliate information to the registry), eST files also write to a cookie when launched. When the user bypasses the product's integrated purchase features and instead buys the product through your <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span> web store, cookie information (if present) is used to credit the affiliate for the sale. (The cookie tracking method applies only to web store purchases made with Internet Explorer.)</p>
        <h3>About Hosted eST</h3>
        <p>If you use Hosted eST and Landing Pages, the basics of eST include a few options in addition to those described at <a href="#eSellerateAffiliates_686029767_88328" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">About eST</a>. The difference is that for steps 4 and 5, affiliates can make customized eST files available to users without having to host those files themselves.</p>
        <p>When Hosted eST and Landing Pages are available, the basics of eST are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">You create a single Windows executable file (typically an installer) that delivers an <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span>-powered product with try and buy functionality. </li>
            <li value="2">You upload the file to the <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span> servers. </li>
            <li value="3">When one of your affiliates elects to sell your product through the eST option, <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span> dynamically customizes the file for use by that affiliate. </li>
            <li value="4">The affiliate provides a link on its web site that allows users to download the customized file from <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span>'s servers. This could be a direct link to the download, or a link to a Landing Page that allows users to download the file. </li>
            <li value="5">A user downloads the file through the link on the affiliate's site. </li>
            <li value="6">When launched, the file writes affiliate information to the Windows registry. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span>&#160;As a backup to the primary tracking method (writing affiliate information to the registry), eST files also write to a cookie when launched. When the user bypasses the product's integrated purchase features and instead buys the product through your <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span> web store, cookie information (if present) is used to credit the affiliate for the sale. (The cookie tracking method applies only to web store purchases made with Internet Explorer.)</p>
        <h3>Creating an eST Download</h3>
        <p>Before you begin, you should have already set up the preceding portions of the Available SKU Detail page. With that complete, the next step is to upload a file (or select an existing one) that meets the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">The primary SKU offered must be the same one listed on the Available SKU Detail page.</li>
            <li value="2">The file must be a single Windows executable (typically an installer) that delivers an eSellerate-powered product with try and buy functionality. This could be any of the following: <ul><li value="1">An installer executable  containing an Integrated eSeller or an Embedded Web Store eSeller (see also <a href="Affiliates_eSTandEWS.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">eST and Embedded Web Store eSellers</a>)</li><li value="2">An alternative option for publishers not selling their product through Integrated eSellers or Embedded Web Store eSellers (see <a href="Affiliates_InAppBuy.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">In-App Buy URL</a>)</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are ready to make your SKU available for affiliates to sell through "Buy" and "Try" links, click <span class="strong">Save Changes</span>. Otherwise, you can first test the eST download as described at <a href="Affiliates_TestingeST.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">Testing eST Downloads</a>.</p>
