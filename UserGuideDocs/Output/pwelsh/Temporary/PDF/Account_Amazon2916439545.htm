        <p>Normally, publishers selling physical products through eSellerate take care of all the fulfillment duties, from receiving shipping requests to shipping the products and marking the orders as fulfilled. As an alternative, we also offer the ability to integrate with Amazon Fulfillment, a service that enables merchants to outsource fulfillment of their products.  Publishers who use this option can set up their eSellerate stores to send fulfillment requests to Amazon when orders require shipping. After shipping the items, Amazon sends "Your order has shipped" e-mails to the customers, and notifies eSellerate that fulfillment is complete. We then mark the orders as fulfilled.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print,Primary.Online">Integration with Amazon Fulfillment is supported for Web Store eSellers (with Custom Layouts or Standard Layouts) and Embedded Web Store eSellers.</p>
        <p>Publishers who use this option are solely responsible for their business relationships with Amazon Fulfillment. These responsibilities include everything from creating an account to maintaining inventory and paying Amazon for its services.</p>
        <p>The ability to integrate with Amazon Fulfillment is available on request. If you're interested in this option, please contact your assigned account executive.</p>
        <h4>More Information</h4>
        <p>When you request this option, your account executive will provide documentation for using the Amazon Fulfillment features of eSellerate.</p>
