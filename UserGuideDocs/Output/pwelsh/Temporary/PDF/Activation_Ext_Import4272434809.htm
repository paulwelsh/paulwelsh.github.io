            <MadCap:keyword term="Product Activation:activating external serial numbers;serial numbers:activating external" />Importing External Serial Numbers for Activation</h2>
        <p>This option extends the piracy protection of eSellerate Product Activation to software sold outside the eSellerate system. It involves importing serial numbers that were issued for non-eSellerate orders, and paying a fee to activate each of those serial numbers. (There is never a fee to activate serial numbers issued for eSellerate orders.)</p>
        <h5>To get started using this option, do the following:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Select a fee structure.</li>
            <li value="2">Import serial numbers for Product Activation.</li>
            <li value="3">Activate the imported serial numbers.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Selecting a Fee Structure</h3>
        <p>There are two fee structures available to suit your individual needs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Per-activation – You pay a set fee for each new, unique activation of a given serial number.</li>
            <li value="2">Lifetime – You pay a set fee for unlimited activations of a given serial number.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Notes</h5>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">A per-activation fee applies when your software initiates a new, unique activation, which can involve any of the following API calls: Purchase, CheckForUpdate, Reinstall, ActivateSerialNumber and ManualActivateSerialNumber. After your software initiates a new, unique activation of a given serial number, no fee applies for subsequent activations of that serial number on the same computer, unless the machine configuration changes significantly. Also, no fee applies when your software checks the local computer for previous activation information, which typically involves an API call to ValidateActivation.</li>
            <li value="2">The fee structure you choose will also apply to any activations of manually generated serial numbers. See <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/SKU_Management/Serial_Manual.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="Manually Generating Serial Numbers"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Manually Generating Serial Numbers" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please contact your eSellerate account executive for help with choosing an activation fee structure.</p>
        <h3>Importing Serial Numbers for Product Activation</h3>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> If you use Product Activation with manually generated serial numbers, you should not import those serial numbers through the interface on the Product Activation Sets page. The act of generating the serial numbers makes them known to the eSellerate system, so there is no need for a separate import process.</p>
        <p>As explained in <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/SKU_Management/Activation_Overview.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="Setting Up Product Activation"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Setting Up Product Activation" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>, serial numbers used in Product Activation must be unique.</p>
        <p>You will need to save the serial numbers in a comma-delimited file (.csv) or a tab-delimited file (.txt). The required format is as follows:</p>
        <p>number&lt;delimiter&gt;quantity<br />number&lt;delimiter&gt;quantity<br />number&lt;delimiter&gt;quantity</p>
        <p>Quantity refers to the number of products purchased in the non-eSellerate order (that use the given serial number). This value determines the number of activations and deactivations to allow for the serial number based on settings such as "Activations Per Quantity" and "Deactivations Beyond Quantity" in the Product Activation set.</p>
        <p>In addition to commas or tabs, you can also use quotation marks as delimiters, but the quotation marks are not required. For example, any of the following formats will work for importing serial numbers:</p>
        <p>"number","quantity"<br />"number"&lt;tab&gt;"quantity"<br />number,quantity<br />number&lt;tab&gt;quantity</p>
        <p>When you're ready to import serial numbers, go to the External Serial Number Import section of the Product Activation Sets page. Click <span class="strong">Browse </span>(or <span class="strong">Choose File</span> if you're using Chrome or Safari) to locate the serial number file. Then click <span class="strong">Import</span>.</p>
        <h3>Activating the Imported Serial Numbers </h3>
        <p>After importing serial numbers to the eSellerate system, you can activate the serial numbers as needed.</p>
