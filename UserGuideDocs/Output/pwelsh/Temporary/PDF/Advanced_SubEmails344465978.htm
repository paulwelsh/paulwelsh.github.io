        <p>The E-mails tab of the Subscription Detail page provides links that you can click to view sample content for the e-mail notifications listed. These samples do not reflect any actual settings for the selected subscription method.</p>
        <p>The samples for renewal reminders and expiration notices represent the automatic notifications that eSellerate sends to customers for certain subscription events. The "7 day" notifications are required (except with "until cancellation" subscriptions), and the others are optional. For more information on these notifications, see <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/Advanced_Sales_Options/Advanced_SubDetails.htm#AdvancedSalesOptions_3786514807_271012" MadCap:xrefTarget="Subscriptions: Details"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Subscriptions: Details" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>You can also view samples of the notifications eSellerate sends to customers for certain billing topics. These samples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Pre-Frequency Billing – When a subscription has billing frequencies that occur within the duration, such as monthly billings for a 12-month duration, eSellerate sends reminders to the customers seven days in advance of each billing. </li>
            <li value="2">CC Expiration Notice – When a credit card on file for charging a subscription is about to expire, eSellerate notifies the customer (30 days in advance) and provides instructions on how to update the credit card information through eSellerate After-Purchase Services. </li>
            <li value="3">Billing Failed Notice – When a billing for a subscription fails because of issues with the payment method, eSellerate notifies the customer and provides instructions on how to update the payment method information through eSellerate After-Purchase Services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> You can use preview orders to test these e-mail notifications. If you're viewing a preview order that involved subscriptions, the Order Detail page will provide options for testing these e-mails and other subscription events.
