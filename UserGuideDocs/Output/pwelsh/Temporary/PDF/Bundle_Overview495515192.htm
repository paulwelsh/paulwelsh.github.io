        <p>You can use this feature to sell a collection of SKUs as a bundle.</p>
        <h5>Notes on bundles</h5>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">A bundle is a parent SKU that contains child SKUs.</li>
            <li value="2">You can set the following properties at the bundle/parent SKU level, or you can allow each child SKU to set the properties separately:<ul><li value="1">Delivery Method</li><li value="2">eCD File</li><li value="3">eCD Layout</li><li value="4">SKU Download</li><li value="5">Serial Number</li><li value="6">Terms of Sale</li><li value="7">Subscription</li><li value="8">eCD Delivery Frequency</li><li value="9">Order E-mail and Receipt Text</li></ul></li>
            <li value="3">As an example of setting properties, if you set a SKU download at the bundle level, your customers will download one file when they purchase the bundle. Otherwise, if you allow each child SKU to set a download, your customers will download a separate file for each of the SKUs. (This example assumes that you do not override the SKU download at the eSeller level.) For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/SKU_Management/SKU_Bundle.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="Setting Up the SKU as a Bundle (Optional)"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Setting Up the SKU as a Bundle (Optional)" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li value="4">Not all SKUs may be available for bundling. SKUs that are themselves bundles or that are available to channels cannot be contained in a bundle. A SKU that is offered through an Integrated eSeller cannot be made a bundle.</li>
            <li value="5">For a bundle to be available for sale in an eSeller, all of the child SKUs must also belong to that eSeller. The child SKUs can be available for sale individually, or you can hide them by setting their statuses to Hidden.</li>
            <li value="6">Most eSellerate features work the same for bundles as they do for any other SKUs. Features that may warrant some additional consideration when using them with bundles are listed in the following section.</li>

                    <td class="TableStyle_Rows_Body_0_0_RowSep_ColEnd">
                        <ul>
                            <li value="1">If you apply a subscription at the bundle level, there will be a charge to the customer's payment method for the initial purchase, followed by a charge for each scheduled billing during the duration of the subscription. This behavior is the same as for any other SKU (with the exception of child SKUs). 
</li>
                            <li value="2">If you apply a subscription at the child SKU level, there will be no subscription charges at the time of purchase. Instead, the subscription charges will begin with the first scheduled billing. This behavior allows you to set a regular price on the bundle (which customers will pay at the time of purchase) and use subscriptions for the child SKUs. 
</li>
                            <li value="3">If you use a combination of regular pricing and subscriptions with bundles, you should make sure your customers understand the charges they are incurring. For example, in the following scenario, some customers might not realize they are incurring costs beyond the $300.00 for the initial purchase: 
<ul><li value="1">Bundle A = $300, one-time cost at the time of purchase 
</li><li value="2">Child SKU 1 = $10 monthly for 12 months, first billing one month after the purchase 
</li><li value="3">Child SKU 2 = $20 monthly for 12 months, first billing one month after the purchase 
</li></ul></li>
                            <li value="4">With the preceding scenario, the potential for error can be even greater if you allow multi-quantity sales for the bundle. For example, a customer who purchases a quantity of 2 will have total billings of $60 per month with this bundle, in addition to the $600 for the initial purchase. 
</li>
                            <li value="5">The subscription terms of conditions of individual child SKUs are consolidated into one block of text that customers will need to agree to when purchasing the bundle. 
</li>
                            <li value="6">When a bundle includes multiple child SKUs with subscriptions, customers who purchase the bundle are starting separate subscriptions for each of the SKUs. Each SKU has its own billings and steps that may be required for renewals.</li>

As with other conditionally required variables, the inspection process will show a warning if you have excluded any of these variables from your layout.

                            <li value="1">When a bundle is added to the shopping cart as an up-sell, the quantities of SKUs already in the cart may be decreased to prevent unintended duplicates. For example, assume that the cart contains SKU A with quantity 2 and SKU B with quantity 1. If Bundle C includes SKU A and SKU B, when that bundle is added to the cart as an up-sell (with quantity 1) the behavior is as follows: 
<ul><li value="1">Decrease the quantity of SKU A to 1. 
</li><li value="2">Remove SKU B from the cart. 
</li><li value="3">After these adjustments, the items remaining in the cart are Bundle C with quantity 1 and SKU A with quantity 1.

                            <li value="2">When a bundle is added to the cart as a regular item (not an up-sell or a cross-sell), the behavior is the same as listed above for the up-sell scenario. 
</li>
                            <li value="3">In contrast to the previous two scenarios, adding a bundle to the cart as a cross-sell item has no effect on the quantities of SKUs already in the cart. The reason is that cross-sell offers are in addition to what customers have selected for their purchases.

<br /><br />Because the indexing is zero-based, this example refers to the fifth serial number for the fourth item in the cart. That fourth item could be a plain SKU, or a bundle SKU with a serial number set assigned to the parent. Also, to allow for the multiple serial numbers, that fourth item would have "Issue serial numbers in ratio to quantity" enabled. 
</li>
                            <li value="2">To activate a serial number for a bundle/parent SKU, you can use the same methods as you would for a plain SKU. Your options include: <ul><li value="1">Pass the SKU ID and an activation ID in the parameters of a Purchase or CheckForUpdate call. This approach works for single serial numbers only. When multiple serial numbers are issued—which can occur when the parent has "Issue serial numbers in ratio to quantity" enabled—none of the serial numbers will be activated. If you need to activate one of the serial numbers in that instance, you can use the method below. 
</li><li value="2">Get the serial number from result data (returned from Purchase or CheckForUpdate calls) or some location where you have stored it, and activate it by calling ActivateSerialNumber. 
</li></ul></li>
                            <li value="3">You cannot use Purchase or CheckForUpdate calls to activate serial numbers for child SKUs, because those calls do not provide a way to specify the child SKUs. An alternative is to get the serial numbers from result data (returned from Purchase or CheckForUpdate calls) and activate each serial number by calling ActivateSerialNumber.
