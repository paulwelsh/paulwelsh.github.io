        <p>Publishers who localize their web stores for multiple languages can use the Lexicon page to localize text strings on the layout.   </p>
        <h4>Localizing Layout Content (the Lexicon)</h4>
        <p>As mentioned in the <a href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/Miscellaneous/LocalizingStores.htm">overview</a>, text on new store layouts is localized in all supported languages. Publishers can customize most text and translations, or take them as they are, ready to go. Information on customizing these items follows.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong" style="color: #ff0000;">Warning:</span> Before you edit any of the default lexicon strings, please consider the following: Default lexicon strings will receive any updates that eSellerate pushes out for them, but overridden strings do not receive those updates. So, you can override a string or you can allow it to receive future updates, but not both. </p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> If you haven't already specified the languages that you want to use for localizing your stores, click <span class="strong">Select Languages</span>. Make your selections, and then click <span class="strong">Save Changes</span>, which will return you to the Lexicon page.</p>
        <h5>To edit text strings on the Lexicon page:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">You can view the lexicon by name (the default view), or by language. To switch the view, click the button that is currently appearing in the bottom right corner—either <span class="strong">View by Language</span> or <span class="strong">View by Name</span>.</li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>To edit any text string shown on the Lexicon page, click in its field and make your changes. You can also paste in data.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> The Keywords and the Comment fields have a limit of 1,000 characters each.  Strings longer than that limit will be truncated on saves.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3"> At any time during your edits, you can save your work by clicking <span class="strong">Save Changes</span>.</li>
            <li value="4">If you edit a text string (other than one that you created yourself) and later want to restore it to its default value, do the following:<ol><li value="1">If you're not already viewing by name, click <span class="strong">View by Name</span>.</li><li value="2">From the <span class="strong">Named Strings</span> list, select the string that you want to restore to its default.</li><li value="3">Click <span class="strong">Default</span>.</li></ol></li>
        </ol>
        <p>If needed, you can add a text string to the lexicon, and manage how that string displays in stores by using a string variable in the form of _String.<i>name</i>. (This approach requires adding the string variable to Custom Layouts.)</p>
        <h5>To add a text string to the lexicon:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Make sure the current view is by name, rather than by language.</li>
            <li value="2">Click <span class="strong">New</span>. </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Enter a name, which must have no spaces, begin with a letter, and contain only letters, digits, or underscores. This will be the <i>name</i> for your string variable. </p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong" style="color: #ff0000;">Warning:</span> We recommend that you always check for possible duplicate names before you add text strings to the lexicon. If you add a text string with a name that is already in use (regardless of case, because the names are case-insensitive), you will overwrite the existing text string instead of creating a new one.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Fill out the other fields as needed.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> The Keywords and the Comment fields have a limit of 1,000 characters each.  Strings longer than that limit will be truncated on saves.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> Strings that are left blank will not show up for the corresponding language in the web store. For example, if the web store is showing Spanish, but the Spanish string for Address1 was left blank in the lexicon, then nothing will appear for Address1. (The stores don't drop back to English, or any other language, for strings that are left blank in the lexicon.) </p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">Click <span class="strong">Save Changes</span>. (If the name that you entered happens to be a reserved name, you will be prompted to use a different name.)</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> We recommend that you frequently back up any text strings that you've added to the lexicon—ideally every time that you finish making significant changes. By exporting the lexicon to Excel and archiving the Excel files somewhere, you will have a way to easily restore your most recent work if data is ever lost.</p>
        <h5>To delete a text string that you have added to the lexicon:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Make sure the current view is by name, rather than by language.</li>
            <li value="2">From the <span class="strong">Named Strings</span> list, select the string that you want to delete.</li>
            <li value="3">Click <span class="strong">Delete</span>. </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Searching for Text Strings by Keyword</h4>
        <p>When the current view is by language, you can make the page show text strings that match certain keywords. </p>
        <h5>To search for text strings by using one keyword:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Make sure the current view is by language, rather than by name.</li>
            <li value="2">In the <span class="strong">Keywords </span>field, enter the keyword for this search.</li>
            <li value="3">Click <span class="strong">match</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>To search for text strings by using multiple keywords:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Make sure the current view is by language, rather than by name.</li>
            <li value="2">In the <span class="strong">Keywords </span>field, enter the keywords for this search. Use a space between each keyword.</li>
            <li value="3">Do one of the following:<ul><li value="1">To find strings that use all of the specified keywords, click <span class="strong">match all</span>.</li><li value="2">To find strings that use at least one of the specified keywords, click <span class="strong">match any</span>.</li></ul></li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Exporting the Lexicon to Excel for Backups and External Editing</h4>
        <p>As an alternative to editing text strings one-by-one on the Lexicon page, you can export the lexicon to Excel for editing, and later import the modified Excel file. The export will include the languages that you have enabled on the Select Languages page. (Exports always include English, regardless of whether that language is enabled.)</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> Because Excel cells have a 32,767-character limit, exports will not be permitted if any elements in the lexicon are larger than 32K. In that case, you'll need to work on the lexicon through the Sales Manager interface only, without doing any exporting or importing.</p>
        <p>To export the lexicon, click <span class="strong">Export Lexicon to Excel</span>, and then save the file.</p>
        <h4>Importing the Lexicon from Excel</h4>
        <p class="pwNote"><strong style="color: #ff0000;">Warning:</strong> Before you import from Excel, make sure that you have already backed up the lexicon in its current state by exporting to Excel. Backing up the lexicon is critical because it is possible for you to mistakenly wipe out data on imports.</p>
        <p>When you're ready to import an edited lexicon, and you've heeded the preceding warning about backups, click <span class="strong">Import Lexicon from Excel</span>. Click <span class="strong">Browse</span> (or <span class="strong">Choose File</span> if you're using Chrome or Safari),  locate an Excel file for importing, and then click <span class="strong">Process File</span>.</p>
