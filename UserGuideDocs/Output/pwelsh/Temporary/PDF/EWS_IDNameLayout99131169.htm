For more information, see:<ul><li value="1"> <![CDATA[ ]]><MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/Embedded_Web_Store_eSellers/EWS_Main.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="Embedded Web Store eSellers"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Embedded Web Store eSellers" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref></li><li value="2"><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print">Chapter 1 of the eSellerate SDK Reference</MadCap:conditionalText></li></ul></li>

                    <MadCap:keyword term="US tax-inclusive pricing:enabling for Embedded Web Store eSellers" /><span class="strong">Use US Tax-Inclusive Pricing</span> <![CDATA[ ]]>– By default, the pricing in this store will exclude US tax, so that customers pay the unit prices plus any applicable US tax. Another option is to use US tax-inclusive pricing, which ensures your customers pay the exact prices shown on your store's catalog pages, with no additional costs when taxes apply. (In the shopping cart, US tax will be subtracted from the original prices, and the total tax amount will be displayed as a separate line item.) To include US tax in the pricing for this store, select the <span class="strong">Use US Tax-Inclusive Pricing</span> check box. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/Miscellaneous/TaxInclusive.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="Tax-Inclusive Pricing"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Tax-Inclusive Pricing" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Caution</span>:&#160;If you switch to tax-inclusive pricing, your net earnings will be reduced unless you increase the prices of all items in this store to make up for the tax amounts. To make those adjustments, we recommend using Native Currency Pricing, which will allow you to set pricing for SKUs, eCD and other items in your customers' preferred currencies.

Another option is to use VAT-inclusive pricing, which ensures your customers pay the exact prices shown on your store's catalog pages, with no additional costs when VAT applies.
