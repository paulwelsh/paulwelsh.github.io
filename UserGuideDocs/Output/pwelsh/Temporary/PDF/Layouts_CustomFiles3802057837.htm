            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>More details on the functions provided by the Files tab follow.</p>
        <h4><a name="Listing1"></a>Listing Layout Files by Type</h4>
        <p>All layout files are accessible from the Files tab. Use the <span class="strong">Show</span> list to list layout files by type, such as HTML files or image files, or to list all files. (Selecting <span class="strong">All Files</span> will not list deleted files, which must be listed separately.) </p>
        <p>A layout file's status will indicate whether it has been created, modified, renamed or deleted since the last publish date. Otherwise, if the file is current, no status will be shown.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> Renamed status does not necessarily indicate that only the file name has changed. A file with Renamed status has been renamed, and possibly modified, since the last publish date.<br /></p>
        <p>To select layout files for actions such as delete and duplicate, do one of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">To select individual files, select the check box to the left of the file. </li>
            <li value="2">To select all files listed, select the check box in the table heading. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a name="Editing1"></a>Editing Layout Files Within the Sales Manager</h4>
        <p>You can duplicate or delete layout files. After deleting a file, you have the option to undelete it at any time before you publish the modified layout. To undelete a file, click the <span class="strong">Show</span> list and select <span class="strong">Deleted Files</span>. Select the check box to the left of the desired file and then click <span class="strong">Undelete</span>.</p>
        <p>To add a blank HTML file to the layout, click <span class="strong">New HTML File</span>. If you need to add another type of layout file, you will need to create the file offline and upload it.</p>
        <p>HTML and CSS files allow direct editing within the Sales Manager. To edit one of these layout files, click its <span class="strong">File Name</span> field to display the Text File Editor page. From that page, you can do any of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Rename the file        <ul><li value="1">Duplicate layout file names are not allowed. </li><li value="2">The maximum file name length is 255 characters. </li></ul></li>
            <li value="2">Type or paste in code changes </li>
            <li value="3">Render the HTML code in a new browser window<ul><li value="1">The rendered HTML will show formatting, but it will not read in live data for eSellerate elements such as images and variable values.</li><li value="2">This option is available on Internet Explorer only. Other browsers do not show a button for rendering the HTML code.</li></ul></li>
            <li value="4">Revert changes made to the file since the last publish date </li>
            <li value="5">Use the Tags, Variables and Functions links to find information on the eSellerate HTML extensions that extend the functionality of standard HTML </li>
            <li value="6">Save or discard your changes </li>
        </ul>

        </ol>
        <h4><a name="Uploading1"></a>Uploading Layout Files</h4>
        <p>After working on files offline, you can upload them to your layout.</p>
        <p>Points to note before you upload files:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">The maximum number of files that you can upload at one time is 100 when using Internet Explorer for Windows and eight for other configurations. </li>
            <li value="2">Uploading an existing file will replace it. </li>
            <li value="3">The maximum file size allowed for uploads is 128 KB for HTML and CSS files and 1 MB for all other files. </li>
            <li value="4">Duplicate layout file names are not allowed. </li>
            <li value="5">The maximum file name length is 255 characters. </li>
            <li value="6">eSelleratesupports uploading HTML files that have either .htm or .html file extensions. Both will be shown as type HTML within the layout. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To upload files, click <span class="strong">Upload Files</span> and follow the instructions provided.</p>
        <h4><a name="Discarding1"></a>Discarding Changes Made to the Layout</h4>
        <p>If you need to discard changes that you've made to the layout, you can do so for individual files or for the entire layout, as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">To revert changes made to an individual layout file since the last publish date, click the file's <span class="strong">File Name</span> field, which will bring up the Text File Editor. Then click <span class="strong">Revert Content</span>. Also note: <ul><li value="1">Reverting will only revert content. If a file has been renamed since the last publish date, the file name will be unchanged. </li><li value="2">If a file is the only one in the layout that has been modified since the last publish date, reverting the file will change the layout's status back to current. </li><li value="3">Revert is file name based. If there's not a published file for the file name selected, it can't be reverted. </li><li value="4">The revert function will only be enabled if the file has been published. </li></ul></li>
            <li value="2">To restore all changes made since the last publish date, click <span class="strong">Restore Published Layout</span>. This will restore the Files and Settings tabs to the configuration of the published layout. Also note: <ul><li value="1">If a file has been deleted since the last publish date, it will be restored. </li><li value="2">If a file has been renamed since the last publish date, the restored file will use the original file name. </li><li value="3">Layout Name, Comment and Test Layout Certificate on the Settings tab will not be restored. </li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a name="Inspecting1"></a>Inspecting the Layout</h4>
        <p>Inspection is a process that you can initiate to check that the eSellerate tags, commands and defined variables are correctly used, so the layout functions properly within the eSellerate system. Inspection does not take into account any Sales Manager store settings (such as eSeller or SKU configurations set up in your eSellerate account) that may affect your layout.</p>
        <p>Inspection proceeds in two phases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Syntax analysis phase: <ul><li value="1">eSelleratechecks the structure of all HTML files in the layout (deleted files are excluded). </li><li value="2">At most, one syntax error will be reported per file. </li><li value="3">If any syntax error is found, inspection will be terminated and the error(s) will be reported on the Inspection Results page. </li></ul></li>
            <li value="2">Semantic analysis phase: <ul><li value="1">Inspection checks the usage of eSellerate tags, commands and defined variables in all files. Errors or warnings will be reported on the Inspection Results page.<ul><li value="1">Warnings (which you can choose to ignore, but could cause runtime errors) </li><li value="2">Errors (which you must correct before the layout can pass inspection and you can publish the layout) </li></ul></li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>A few important points to help you avoid errors in the inspection process are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Avoid basic syntax errors by using proper HTML structure. </li>
            <li value="2">Do not begin your file names with an underscore. File names that begin with an underscore are reserved for use by eSellerate. </li>
            <li value="3">Make sure to designate HTML pages on the Settings tab as First Page, Cart Page, Catalog Page and Error Page. These settings are required and must reference existing HTML pages in your layout. All other page settings are optional. </li>
            <li value="4">Use no more than one pair of each of the following tags in an HTML file: BODY, FORM and _CONTENT.</li>
            <li value="5">Make sure eSellerate commands and tags contain required attributes, such as the following: <ul><li value="1">_Cmd "Buy" and _Cmd "Remove" require _SkuRefNum. </li><li value="2">_Cmd "GOTO" requires _Page. </li><li value="3">&lt;_Loop&gt; tags must have VAR attribute referencing a valid specifier. The possible specifiers are _Cart, _Catalog, _Category, _CrossSell, _Order and _Shipping. </li><li value="4">See the Tags page for a complete list of eSellerate commands and tags. Items in bold red indicate required attributes. </li></ul></li>
            <li value="6">Make sure your layout contains all eSellerate "Required" variables. These are indicated at the pages that list variables for use with Custom Layouts and variables for use in coding Embedded Web Store eSellers. </li>
            <li value="7">Do not include opening or closing brackets in variable name values that you assign. If you need to display information enclosed in brackets, you can use button graphics to provide that look. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Warnings indicate there may be an issue that needs to be addressed in your layout, depending on the Sales Manager store settings used in conjunction with the layout. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">A warning will be logged if any eSellerate conditionally required variables (denoted with orange checkmarks in the variables table) are not present in any HTML file. For instance, if _Shopper.ShippingAddress1 is not present, a warning will be displayed. Shipping is only required if one or more of your eSeller SKUs require shipping, or if you are using eSellerate's  eCD feature. If this is the case, all conditionally required shipping variables will need to be defined in your layout to properly handle shipping in orders that require it. At runtime, if these variables are not present and shipping is required, the eSellerate system will present an emergency input page that requires the customer to enter this information. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a name="Testing1"></a>Testing the Layout</h4>
        <p>The Files tab provides an interface for testing the layout against any of your Web Store and Embedded Web Store eSellers.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span>&#160;In contrast to eSeller testing methods such as the Preview URL for web stores, this test uses the edited version of the layout, rather than the published version. As a reminder of this distinction, an "UNPUBLISHED LAYOUT" banner will display at the bottom of the store pages.</p>
        <p>To test the layout, do the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">In the <span class="strong">Test using</span> list, select the desired eSeller. </li>
            <li value="2">Do one of the following: <ul><li value="1">If you would like to test the layout with a preview order, select <span class="strong">Preview SKUs</span>. In this case, the test will automatically use the Preview Certificate assigned to the eSeller in use, and the Layout Test Certificate assigned to the layout. As with all preview orders, eSellerate's preview banner will display at the bottom of the store pages, and payment processing will execute in demo mode only, so that no charges occur. </li><li value="2">If you would like to test the layout with an actual order, select <span class="strong">Active SKUs</span>. Please note that actual  charges to your payment method will occur if you complete the order. </li></ul></li>
            <li value="3">Click <span class="strong">Test Layout</span>. This will open a new browser window, which in the case of Embedded Web Store eSellers will honor the width and height settings configured in the Settings tab. </li>
        </ol>
        <h4><a name="Publishing1"></a>Publishing the Layout</h4>
        <p>A layout can have one of three statuses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Current, which indicates the layout has not been edited since the last publish date </li>
            <li value="2">Modified, which indicates the layout has been modified since the last publish date, but has not yet passed inspection </li>
            <li value="3">Pending, which indicates the layout has been modified since the last publish date and has passed inspection, but has not yet been published </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Publishing a layout replaces the previous layout and makes the new layout available for use with your active Web Store and Embedded Web Store eSellers. Before you click <span class="strong">Publish</span>, be sure to test the layout using the eSellers your customers will be using.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong" style="color: #ff0000;">Warning:</span> Publishing a layout can affect stores that are in use by your customers. For this reason, it is advisable to publish your layouts at times when you can expect low customer traffic. If layout changes during a customer visit are significant enough to cause an error, the store will display the following message: "This store has just been updated. To ensure an accurate purchase process, please start over, beginning <span class="_Override" style="text-decoration: underline;">here</span>." The customer can click the provided link to start over from the page designated as First Page on the Settings tab. </p>
