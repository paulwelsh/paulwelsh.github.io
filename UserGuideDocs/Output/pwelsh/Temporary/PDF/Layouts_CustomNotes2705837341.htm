        <ul>
            <li value="1">There are two primary layout options for your web stores: Custom Layouts (described here) and Standard Layouts. Custom Layouts will provide you with a great deal of flexibility for customizing your web stores. Standard Layouts may work for you if you need only limited customization. You can preview the available Standard Layout options on the Web Store eSeller Detail page.
            </li>
            <li value="2">Custom Layouts are optional for Web Store eSellers and the required layout method for Embedded Web Store eSellers. (Web Store eSellers also work with Standard Layouts, which allow limited customization.)  Integrated eSellers do not use Custom Layouts.</li>
            <li value="3">Custom Layouts are defined as normal HTML pages, so you can use any HTML editor to design your layouts. </li>
            <li value="4">eSellerate provides several default layouts that collectively cover all the basic functionality you should need from your Custom Layouts. You will use one of these default layouts as a starting point for any Custom Layout you create. </li>
            <li value="5">Because all Custom Layouts start out as functional layouts, the changes that you make to the default settings can be as minimal as replacing the default banner graphic (banner.jpg) with one of your own. </li>
            <li value="6">Looking at the default layouts is the best way to understand Custom Layouts functionality. Be sure to review the extensive comments in the HTML code. </li>
            <li value="7">A reference that shows how various Custom Layout elements can look when viewed from an HTML editor and when rendered is available for downloading through the eSellerate Downloads page. The link for accessing the downloads is on the Sales Manager home page, under the "What's New for eSellerate" information.  (Use the "Custom Layout Quick Reference" link.)</li>
            <li value="8">Custom Layouts use eSellerate HTML extensions that extend the functionality of standard HTML. These special extensions include the following: <ul><li value="1">Commands for controlling the shopping cart behavior </li><li value="2">Tags for creating loops and conditional statements </li><li value="3">Functions for performing certain actions or obtaining certain values</li><li value="4">Variables for reading or setting values </li></ul></li>
            <li value="9">The following help pages document  eSellerate tags, functions and variables. For your convenience when working on layouts that you have downloaded from eSellerate, these pages are accessible without logging in to your publisher account. The URLs are as follows: <ul><li value="1">Tags <br /><a><a href="http://publishers.esellerate.net/tags.aspx" target="_blank">http://publishers.esellerate.net/tags.aspx</a></a> <![CDATA[ ]]></li><li value="2">Functions<br /><a><a href="http://publishers.esellerate.net/functions.aspx" target="_blank">http://publishers.esellerate.net/functions.aspx</a></a></li><li value="3">Variables for use with Custom Layouts<br /><a><a href="http://publishers.esellerate.net/customvar.aspx" target="_blank">http://publishers.esellerate.net/customvar.aspx</a></a> <![CDATA[ ]]></li><li value="4">Variables for use in coding Embedded Web Store eSellers<br /><a><a href="http://publishers.esellerate.net/embeddedvar.aspx" target="_blank">http://publishers.esellerate.net/embeddedvar.aspx </a></a></li></ul></li>
            <li value="10">For information on development options that are available for getting more capabilities from your Custom Layouts, see <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/Layouts/Layouts_CLExt.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="Custom Layout Extensions"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Custom Layout Extensions" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>. </li>
            <li value="11">Custom Layouts support the use of cascading style sheets. </li>
            <li value="12">There are no restrictions on the use of scripting languages such as JavaScript and plug-ins such as QuickTime. </li>
            <li value="13">The supported image file extensions are .jpeg, .jpe, .jpg, .gif, .png and .bmp. </li>
            <li value="14">Referencing external images is allowed. </li>
            <li value="15">Non-HTML files that you upload to a layout are automatically placed in a virtual "images" folder. Be sure to include "images/" in the path when you refer to the files in your HTML code. For instance, after uploading an image file named "my_logo.gif" and a CSS file named "my_styles.css" you could refer to the files as follows: <ul><li value="1">&lt;img src="../Resources/Images/images/my_logo.gif"&gt; </li><li value="2">&lt;LINK REL="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="images/my_styles.css"&gt; </li></ul></li>
            <li value="16">To add a favicon (URL icon) to a Custom Layout, you can:<ol><li value="1">Upload the icon (for example, MyIcon.ico).</li><li value="2">Add a "shortcut icon" link to the icon in the &lt;head&gt; tag. For example, add the following in the &lt;head&gt; tag of MyTemplate.htm:</li></ol><ul><li class="Indent1" value="1">&lt;link rel="shortcut icon" href="MyIcon.ico" type="image/x-icon"/&gt;</li></ul></li>
            <li value="17">eSellerate allows you to easily create mouseover effects for images used in Custom Layouts, without having to provide your own JavaScript. For each image area that should support mouseover effects, you will need to upload two images to your layout: one to display by default and one to display when the user moves the cursor over the image area. Then include the hsrc attribute when using the &lt;img&gt; tag to display the images. eSellerate will insert the required JavaScript for a mouseover whenever a page correctly uses the hsrc attribute. For an example of correct usage, see the following code, which will display the image "menu_off.jpg" by default, and the image "menu_on.gif" for a mouseover:</li>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">&lt;img border="0" src="images/menu_off.jpg" hsrc="images/menu_on.gif"&gt; </li>
            </ul>
            <li value="18">In addition to mouseover effects as described in the preceding item, Custom Layouts allow the use of Javascript onmousedown and onmouseup events. Sample code follows.<ul><li value="1"><p>&lt;a href="#" onmousedown="alert('hello');" onmouseup="alert('goodbye');"&gt;Test up and down&lt;/a&gt;</p><p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Caution:</span>&#160;If you add a command tag such as <span class="strong">_Cmd="Buy"</span> to this line of code, you will need to remove <span class="strong">href="#"</span>.</p></li></ul></li>
            <li value="19">The total disk space allowed for all Custom Layouts is 5 MB. Deleted files are not included in the disk space calculation. See the Custom Layout page for figures on disk space used and remaining. </li>
            <li value="20">There is no limit to the number of Custom Layouts that can concurrently exist in the Sales Manager (though total disk space restrictions apply). </li>
            <li value="21">Each Custom Layout can support an unlimited number of pages. </li>
            <li value="22">eSellerate features that are available only when using Custom Layouts include: <ul><li value="1">Performing custom prompts for each SKU in the order that requires additional information for serial number generation </li><li value="2">Collecting data with up to 20 custom fields that you define </li><li value="3">Prefilling data into the purchase process, which allows: <ul><li value="1">Adding multiple SKUs to the shopping cart simultaneously </li><li value="2">Performing activations for each SKU in the order that requires Product Activation (Embedded Web Store eSellers only) </li></ul></li></ul></li>
            <li value="23">Custom fields information is reported in the XML order notice. </li>
            <li value="24">A limitation of Custom Layouts is that layouts used by Embedded Web Store eSellers cannot use frames. </li>
        </ul>
