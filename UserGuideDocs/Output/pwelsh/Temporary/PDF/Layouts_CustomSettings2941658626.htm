        <p>When you create a new Custom Layout by using one of the default layouts as your starting point, the Settings tab appears with the <span class="strong">Layout Name</span> field highlighted.  You should replace the default name with a unique one that will help you locate the layout later. The other default settings on the Settings tab should be sufficient in most cases, but you can change them if needed. Information on all the available settings follows.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> When you're finished making changes to the Files tab, be sure to click <span class="strong">Update Settings</span>.</p>
        <h4>Entering a Layout Name and Comment</h4>
        <p>If desired, you can enter a layout name and add a comment. Text that you enter here is for your reference only, and will not be visible to your customers.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span>&#160;Duplicate layout names are allowed. However, there is no built-in way to differentiate between duplicate names when you assign layouts to your eSellers.<br /></p>
        <h4>Making Page Assignments for Key Layout Files</h4>
        <p>Page assignments specify which HTML layout files eSellerate should use for the store's first page, cart page, catalog page and so on. There is no need to edit the default page assignments unless you have significantly changed the functionality of the HTML layout files that they reference.</p>
        <p>The page assignments and their descriptions are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">First Page: This is the page the store displays first when a customer visits. Also, the store will navigate to this page if a processing error requires the customer to start the purchase process over. </li>
            <li value="2">Cart Page: This page provides the shopping cart functionality. </li>
            <li value="3">Catalog Page: This page displays the available products. With Web Store eSellers, the store will navigate to this page if the customer clicks the "Continue Shopping" link from the Receipt page. To learn how to override this page for an individual Web Store eSeller, see the top section of that eSeller's Detail page.</li>
            <li value="4">Error Page: The store will navigate to this page for any errors not covered by eSellerate error messages. </li>
            <li value="5">Template Page: HTML layout files can reference this file for page header and footer information. A Template Page is not required for the layout to pass inspection, but it is required for the functionality described here. See <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/Layouts/Layouts_CustomTemplate.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="Template File"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Template File" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref> for more information. </li>
            <li value="6">Catalog More Info Page: This page displays the referenced SKU's "More Info" Text as set on the Basic tab of the SKU Detail page. A Catalog More Info Page is not required for the layout to pass inspection, but it is required for the functionality described here. </li>
            <li value="7">Trial Download Page: This page displays the referenced SKU's trial download as set at the Web Store SKU Attributes or Embedded Web Store SKU Attributes pages. A Trial Download Page is not required for the layout to pass inspection, but it is required for the functionality described here. See <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/Embedded_Web_Store_eSellers/EWS_AddingSKUs.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="Adding Embedded Web Store SKUs"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Adding Embedded Web Store SKUs" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/Web_Store_eSellers/Web_AddingSKUs.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="Adding Web Store SKUs"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Adding Web Store SKUs" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref> for information on setting the trial downloads. </li>
            <li value="8">Up-Sell Page: This page displays the referenced SKU's up-sell information as set at the Up-Sell SKU Detail page. Use of this page requires a special setting at the Up-Sell SKU Group Detail page. An Up-Sell Page is not required for the layout to pass inspection, but it is required for the functionality described here. See <MadCap:xref MadCap:unresolvedLink="import-link:AdvancedSalesOptions_2735301006_16065" href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/Advanced_Sales_Options/Advanced_CreatingUpSell.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="Creating Up-Sells"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Creating Up-Sells" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref> for information on using the up-sell feature.</li>
            <li value="9">Confirmation Page: This page allows customers to review their order information before they submit their orders. The Billing Information section on this page can display payment details. A Confirmation Page is not required for the layout to pass inspection, but it is required for the functionality described here. See also <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/Miscellaneous/PayPalPayments.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="PayPal Payments"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"PayPal Payments" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li value="10">Receipt Page: This page provides the customer with a receipt at the completion of the purchase. A Receipt Page is not required for the layout to pass inspection, but it is required if you want the ability to customize the receipt. If you do not assign a Receipt Page, a system page will provide the needed functionality. See also <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/Layouts/Layouts_CustomReceiptPag.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="Receipt Page Notes"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Receipt Page Notes" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <span class="strong">Include field errors in error summary</span> check box below the page assignments determines how the store displays errors when the customer attempts to proceed to the next page before completing all required input fields:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">If the check box is selected (the default), the store will display an error next to each input field that requires the customer's attention. </li>
            <li value="2">If the check box is cleared, the store will display a summary of field errors, in addition to displaying an error next to each input field that requires the customer's attention. The error summary typically appears at the top of the store page.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Configuring Layout Settings for Embedded Web Store eSellers (When Applicable)</h4>
        <p>The <span class="strong">Width</span> and <span class="strong">Height </span>fields specify the minimum width and height (in pixels) of the Embedded Web Store eSeller's browser window. These values can be integers only. The allowable values are 100 through 1600 for width and 100 through 1200 for height. As with other settings on this tab, the default width and height values will usually be sufficient.</p>
        <p>The <span class="strong">CheckForUpdate Page</span> list specifies which HTML layout file the Embedded Web Store eSeller should display in response to a CheckForUpdate function call. A CheckForUpdate Page is not required for the layout to pass inspection, but it is required for the functionality described here.</p>
        <p>Similar in functionality to a Preview Certificate, the <span class="strong">Layout Test Certificate</span> allows you to test your Custom Layout before publishing it. When you perform a Purchase or CheckForUpdate function call from your application and use the proper Layout Test Certificate number, the eSeller will use the modified version of your Custom Layout. (You will need to also use the proper Preview Certificate number if you want payment processing to execute in demo mode only, so that no charges occur.) When you're ready to ship this application, just click <span class="strong">Regenerate</span> to clear the Layout Test Certificate. The next time you perform a Purchase or CheckForUpdate function call from your application, the eSeller will use the published version of the Custom Layout referenced in the call.</p>
