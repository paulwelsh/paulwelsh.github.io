        <p>The Fulfillment editor allows you to mark orders as fulfilled after you complete the required shipping. Processing of these orders can then continue in the eSellerate system.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> It is recommended that you ship items within three days of receiving a notice of shipping requirements. Due to time limits on credit card authorizations, eSellerate must process the authorizations 1-2 days before they expire, or cancel orders left unfulfilled at that time.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span>If your account is set up to integrate with Amazon Fulfillment, a search for unfulfilled orders can return orders that are pending fulfillment by Amazon. Normally, these orders are fulfilled automatically, so you do not need to fulfill them yourself. We will notify you if you need to take action on one of these unfulfilled orders.
