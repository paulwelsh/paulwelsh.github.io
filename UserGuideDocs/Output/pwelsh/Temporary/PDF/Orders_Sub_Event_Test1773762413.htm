        <p>If you're viewing a preview order that involved subscriptions, the Order Detail page will provide options for testing subscription events.</p>

        <h4>About Subscription Events Testing</h4>
        <p>When you place a preview order involving subscriptions, after-purchase events that may happen in the life of a real subscription—such as frequency billings and XML posts for changes—do not occur. However, you can still test many of these subscription events by using the options on the Order Detail page for preview orders.            <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <p>To test an event, click its <span class="strong">Test </span>button. The results will appear in the "Results" column. You can then review the e-mails and XML posts that are created.</p>
        <h5>Notes</h5>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">You can use these tests to see the results of events that normally would occur only after a specified time, or in response to certain subscription changes.            <![CDATA[ ]]></li>
            <li value="2">No actual charges occur for any of these tests.</li>
            <li value="3">E-mails for these tests will go to the address listed for the customer in the top section of the Order Detail page. XML posts will go to the URLs specified for your account in the XML Order Notice section of the Account Information page.</li>
            <li value="4">When the order involves more than one subscription, the tests will apply to the first one listed in the Subscriptions section of the Order Detail page (just above the testing area). </li>
            <li value="5">The "Test" column will show "Not Applicable" for tests that are not available because of the current subscription's configuration or status. </li>
            <li value="6">Tests that involve XML posts (see the "Event Triggers This" column) will change the subscription status when applicable. The "Results" column will show the new status in these instances. To see the status change in the Subscriptions section above the testing area, you will need to refresh/reload the page. </li>
        </ul>
