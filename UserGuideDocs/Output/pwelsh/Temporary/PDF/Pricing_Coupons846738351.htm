        <h5>Notes on setting NCP for coupons</h5>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">The option of setting NCP is available for coupons with Preview status only. (You can edit coupons to change their status from Active to Preview as needed.)</li>
            <li value="2">Once you save and activate a coupon, you will not be able to review its pricing configuration through the Coupon tab. However, you can use the Coupons by Currency pricing report for that purpose.</li>
            <li value="3">For each currency listed on the Coupon tab, you can set the minimum order amount, and in some instances, the discount. You cannot edit percentage discounts, or discounts that provide free shipping.</li>
            <li value="4">Make sure that your coupon discounts do not result in order totals that are greater than $0 and less than $1 USD. Because payment processors cannot process transactions for amounts less than $1, a coupon discount that reduces the order total to less than $1 will force eSellerate to provide the product for free. Publishers accept complete responsibility for the setup and implementation of their coupons to prevent this occurrence.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>To set NCP for coupons:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Click the <span class="strong">Pricing </span>tab. The Pricing page appears.</li>
            <li value="2">Click the <span class="strong">Coupon </span>tab. The Coupon Pricing properties appear.<br /><img src="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Output/pwelsh/Temporary/PDF/PDF_1ABAD487/Resources/Images/sku_coupon.jpg" class="PWimg" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" /></li>
            <li value="3">By default, the Coupon tab will display all coupons for which you can set NCP. If you would like to narrow the list down, you can use the provided search functions.</li>
            <li value="4">For each NCP amount that you want to set, click in the appropriate field, and enter a price. To advance from a field after you edit it, you can use the <span class="strong">Tab </span>key, or click in another field.</li>
            <li value="5">When you finish entering NCP amounts, click <span class="strong">Save</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> A field with blue highlighting indicates a price that has been edited but not yet saved.</p>
