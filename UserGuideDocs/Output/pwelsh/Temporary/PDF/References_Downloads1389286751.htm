            <MadCap:keyword term="downloads:creating" />Creating Downloads</h2>
        <p>The Downloads editor allows you to upload files to the eSellerate servers and save the files as download items. You can then assign the downloads to your SKUs in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><span class="strong">SKU Download</span> (Basic tab) – This setting determines the default SKU download, which is the file that customers download when purchasing the SKU or getting a trial version from your web stores. (You can override the default SKU download with an individual eSeller.) See <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/SKU_Management/SKU_Basic.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="Creating the SKU and Setting Its Basic Properties"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Creating the SKU and Setting Its Basic Properties" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li value="2">
                <p><span class="strong">eCD File</span> (Advanced tab) – This setting determines the file that is written to CD to represent the SKU when customers purchase eCD. See <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/SKU_Management/SKU_Advanced.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="Setting the SKU's Advanced Properties (Optional)"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Setting the SKU's Advanced Properties (Optional)" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span>&#160;Another way to set the eCD file is through the eCD Configuration tab. See <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/Advanced_Sales_Options/Advanced_ECDSKU.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="Valid SKUs"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Valid SKUs" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>To create downloads:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Click the <span class="strong">Downloads </span>tab. The Downloads page appears.</li>
            <li value="2">Click <span class="strong">New</span>. The Download Detail page appears.<br /><img src="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Output/pwelsh/Temporary/PDF/PDF_1ABAD487/Resources/Images/reference_download.jpg" class="PWimg" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" /></li>
            <li value="3">Complete the <span class="strong">Description</span> field.</li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Click <span class="strong">Browse </span>(or <span class="strong">Choose File</span> if you're using Chrome or Safari) to select a file for uploading to the eSellerate servers.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span>&#160;Before you upload a Macintosh application (single file or bundle), please compress the item. Use a common format such as Zip (.zip) or Disk Image (.dmg).</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>
                    <MadCap:keyword term="eCD:setting up downloads for eCD use only;downloads:setting up for eCD use only" />If you plan to use the download for eCD only—as opposed to using it as a SKU download—select the <span class="strong">eCD Use Only</span> check box. This will prevent the item from showing up for selection as a SKU&#160;download. </p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> You will not be able to select the <span class="strong">eCD Use Only</span> check box  if the download is already in use as a SKU download. You can use the links provided under Download Usage to change the current download assignments, if needed.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="6">You will need to agree to the Export Compliance Acknowledgement. Click the provided link to read the acknowledgement, and then select the check box that indicates your agreement with the acknowledgement.</li>
            <li value="7">Click <span class="strong">Save Changes</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For information on updating a file that serves as an eST download, see <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/eSellerate_Affiliates/Affiliates_UpdatingeST.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="Updating eST Downloads"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Updating eST Downloads" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h3>Downloads Total and Disk Quota</h3>
        <p>There is a maximum amount of disk space allocated to your account for storing downloads. That amount is shown on the Downloads page as Disk Quota. The amount of disk space that your downloads are using is shown as Downloads Total.</p>
        <p>When you are close to reaching your disk quota, you will see a message about contacting your eSellerate account executive if you would like to increase your quota.</p>
        <p>Once you reach your quota, the <span class="strong">New </span>button will be unavailable. As a result, you will be unable to create any new downloads until you delete some of the existing ones to free up disk space.</p>
        <h3>
            <MadCap:keyword term="downloads:deleting" />Deleting Downloads</h3>
        <p>From the Downloads page, select the download that you want to delete, and then click <span class="strong">Delete</span>. </p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span>&#160;You cannot delete a download if it is being used anywhere in your account. The dialog confirming your deletion attempt will show the download usage. You can use the links provided there to change the current download assignments, if needed.</p>
