        <p>This report supplements the Coupon Pricing feature, which allows you to set pricing in any currency that eSellerate supports. (See also <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/SKU_Management/Pricing_Coupons.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="Setting Native Currency Pricing for Coupons"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Setting Native Currency Pricing for Coupons" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.)</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> A coupon that is set up with a percentage-based discount, and no minimum order amount, will not appear in this report because no currency information applies.</p>
        <h5>To run a Coupons by Currency report:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Click the <span class="strong">Pricing </span>tab. The Pricing Reports page appears.</li>
            <li value="2">Click <span class="strong">Coupons by Currency</span>. The Coupons by Currency page appears.<br /><img src="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Output/pwelsh/Temporary/PDF/PDF_1ABAD487/Resources/Images/report_coupon_currency.jpg" class="PWimg" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" /></li>
            <li value="3">This report can return results as an HTML table, a tab-delimited file, a comma-delimited file or an XML file. Make your selection from the <span class="strong">Return Results As</span> list.</li>
            <li value="4">If desired, select the <span class="strong">Include Inactive Coupons</span> check box.</li>
            <li value="5">Click <span class="strong">Run</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>If you selected HTML table results:</h5>
        <p>The results will include two tables: one for listing coupon amounts by currency, and another for listing minimum order amounts by currency.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> To appear in both tables, a coupon would need to be set up with a dollar-based discount, and a minimum order amount.</p>
        <h5>If you selected comma-delimited, tab-delimited or XML file results:</h5>
        <p>The resulting Save As dialog will display a default file name, which you can change if desired. (The default file extension should be correct for your chosen format.) When you're finished making any changes to the file name, save the file.</p>
        <p>You can now import the file into a database, or open it in a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel.</p>
