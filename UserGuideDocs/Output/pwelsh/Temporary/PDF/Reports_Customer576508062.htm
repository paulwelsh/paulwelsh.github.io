        <p>Use the Customer Reports function to produce customer lists. These lists can be general (such as all customers on record) or more specific (such as all customers in a certain zip code).</p>
        <h5>To run a customer report:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Click the <span class="strong">Customer Reports</span> tab. The Customer Reports page appears.</li>
            <li value="2">Click <span class="strong">Customer Listing</span>. The Customers page appears.<br /><img src="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Output/pwelsh/Temporary/PDF/PDF_1ABAD487/Resources/Images/report_customer.jpg" class="PWimg" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" /></li>
            <li value="3">Use any of the text fields and/or the <span class="strong">Date Range</span> list to narrow the scope of your report, if desired.</li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>By default, the <span class="strong">Include Opt-Out</span> check box is selected. If you clear this check box, the report will only include customers who asked to receive your product update information.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> The "<span class="strong">Send me information about product updates and offers</span>" option that is presented in your stores can be checked or unchecked by default. You set that behavior in the Opt-In/Opt-Out section of the Return &amp; Privacy Policies page. </p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">This report can return results as an HTML table, a tab-delimited file or a comma-delimited file. Make your selection from the <span class="strong">Return Results As</span> list.</li>
            <li value="6">Click <span class="strong">Find Customers</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>If you selected HTML table results:</h5>
        <p>The table will display all customers that matched your report criteria.</p>
        <p>For more information about a customer, click the appropriate <span class="strong">Name </span>field in the Customer List. This will display all orders for that customer that occurred in the specified date range.</p>
        <p>You can now find more information about individual orders and returns for this customer.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Click an <span class="strong">Order Number</span> field for details on an order.</li>
            <li value="2">Click a <span class="strong">Return ID</span> field for details on a return.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> The order and return information that is available through this report does not include your profit or eSellerate's commission on your orders from 4/1/2011 and later.    <![CDATA[ ]]><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print">To find that information and more, please use Business Intelligence reporting. See <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/Reports/Reports_Business_Intel.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="Business Intelligence Reporting"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Business Intelligence Reporting" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <h5>If you selected tab-delimited file results:</h5>
        <p>The resulting Save As dialog will display a default file name, which you can change if desired. In any case, you will need to change the file extension to ".txt" before saving the file (applies to both Windows and Macintosh platforms).</p>
        <p>You can now import the file into a database, or open it in a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel. (Because this is a basic text file, you may need to specify that the data is in tab-delimited format.)</p>
        <h5>If you selected comma-delimited file results:</h5>
        <p>The resulting Save As dialog will display a default file name, which you can change if desired. In any case, you will need to change the file extension to ".csv" before saving the file (applies to both Windows and Macintosh platforms).</p>
        <p>You can now import the file into a database, or open it in a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel. (If a program prompts you to specify a format for this data, select comma-delimited or comma-separated values.)</p>
