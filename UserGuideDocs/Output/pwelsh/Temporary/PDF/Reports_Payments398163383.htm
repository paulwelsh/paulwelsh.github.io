        <p>The Payments report provides the following payment information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Payments due, which are payments for which a voucher has been created, but payment has not yet been made</li>
            <li value="2">Payment history</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> To search for transactions that are not yet associated with a payment, run the Transaction Ledger sales report with <span class="strong">All Unpaid Items</span> selected as the <span class="strong">Transaction List Criteria</span>. (See <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/Reports/Reports_TransactionLedger.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="Transaction Ledger"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Transaction Ledger" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.)</p>
        <h5>To run a Payments report:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Click the <span class="strong">Payments</span> tab. The Payment Reports page appears.</li>
            <li value="2">Click <span class="strong">Payments</span>. The Payments page will display all payment vouchers created in the past 12 months. (Payments due will list "Pending" as the payment date, which indicates that a voucher has been created, but payment has not yet been made.)</li>
            <li value="3">If vouchers exist for previous years, you can click <span class="strong">Show All Vouchers</span> to display them all.</li>
            <li value="4">For more information about a payment, click its <span class="strong">Payment ID</span> field. The resulting page will include a payment summary in the top section, and payment details in the bottom section.
