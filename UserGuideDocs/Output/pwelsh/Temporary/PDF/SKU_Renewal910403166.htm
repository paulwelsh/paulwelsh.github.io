            <MadCap:keyword term="subscriptions:setting renewal behavior" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="SKUs:setting renewal options" />The Renewal tab is available only for SKUs that use subscriptions. Its purpose is to allow customers to choose a different SKU when renewing subscriptions. Your customers may also choose to continue with the original SKU, provided that you offer that SKU at subscription renewal.</p>
        <p>The option of choosing a different SKU will be presented in the renewal reminder e-mails.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> Customers with "until cancellation" subscriptions do not receive renewal reminder e-mails. These customers will need to use eSellerate After-Purchase Services if they want to choose a different SKU for renewal.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> When you add a subscription SKU to an eSeller, be sure to also add all the additional SKUs that you are going to be offering at subscription renewal. This would be all the SKUs listed for the SKU on its Renewal tab, in the SKUs Offered at Subscription Renewal section.</p>
        <h5>Automatic Renewals Only</h5>
        <p>When the original SKU uses an automatic renewal, you can set the default SKU. The default is the SKU that will be used for automatic renewals if the customer does not choose a different one.</p>
        <p>To set the default SKU, select the <span class="strong">Default </span>option for the desired SKU, and then click <span class="strong">Update</span>.</p>
        <h5>All Types of Renewals</h5>
        <h5>To add SKUs that you want to offer at subscription renewal:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">From the SKU Detail page, click the <span class="strong">Renewal</span> tab. The SKU's Renewal properties appear. <br /><img src="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Output/pwelsh/Temporary/PDF/PDF_1ABAD487/Resources/Images/sku_renewal.jpg" class="PWimg" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" /></li>
            <li value="2">When the number of SKUs exceeds a certain number, some SKUs will be hidden. If the SKUs that you want to offer at subscription renewal are not showing, use any of the following methods to find them:<ul><li value="1">To see all the available SKUs, click <span class="strong">Show All (X SKUs)</span>.</li><li value="2">You can search for a SKU by entering all or part of its name. The name search is case-insensitive.</li><li value="3">If your account includes multiple SKU categories (and there are SKUs set up to use them), there will be an option to search by category. (You can create categories for SKUs and Web Store<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print,Primary.Online">/Embedded Web Store</MadCap:conditionalText> eSellers at Home &gt; Categories.)</li></ul></li>
            <li value="3">
                <p> In the SKUs Not Offered section, select the <span class="strong">Offer</span> check box for each SKU that you want to offer.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> To control the order in which SKUs appear as "Renewal Options" in renewal e-mails and eSellerate After-Purchase Services, add the SKUs one at a time in the required order. (You can see the current ordering in the SKUs Offered at Subscription Renewal section.) To make adjustments, remove the SKUs that are out of order, and then add them back in one at a time in the required order.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4"> Click <span class="strong">Add</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>To remove SKUs that you do not want to offer at subscription renewal:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">In the SKUs Offered at Subscription Renewal section, select the <span class="strong">Remove </span>check box for each SKU that you want to remove.</li>
            <li value="2">Do one of the following, depending on which option is available:<ul><li value="1">Click <span class="strong">Remove</span>.</li><li value="2">Click <span class="strong">Update</span>.</li></ul></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> A subscription SKU can renew into a non-subscription SKU. As an example of how this might be useful, your customers who are renewing would have the choice of beginning another subscription term, or buying the product for a lump sum.</p>
