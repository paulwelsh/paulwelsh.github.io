        <p>This option for Standard Enhanced serial number sets provides the means to generate license files for use with the AquaticPrime framework. You can learn about AquaticPrime license files at <a href="http://www.aquaticmac.com/" target="_blank">http://www.aquaticmac.com/</a>. </p>
        <h5>Notes on License Files</h5>
        <ul>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print,Primary.Online" value="1">License file functionality is available for Web Store and Embedded Web Store eSellers only.</li>
            <li value="2">If you set up this option for your serial number set, order receipts and confirmation e-mails will provide a link to allow the customer to download a license file. How your customers use their license files is up to you. If you need to provide instructions for the license file, one way to do that is with the Order E-mail and Receipt Text feature, which is available in the SKU's Advanced tab.</li>
            <li value="3">The download links for license files will be nonfunctional in the following scenarios:<ul><li value="1">While the serial number for the associated SKU is blacklisted (which can be undone)</li><li value="2">When the associated SKU has been returned, or the order has been voided</li></ul></li>
            <li value="4">License file names can be variable to include information such as order ID and serial number. The default file extension is .plist, which you can change to any other extension if needed.</li>
            <li value="5">Generated license files always include a signature, and can optionally include a number of additional items such as date, quantity and registration name. Along with the variable items, there is a Static Data option that you can use to include select data in every license file.</li>
            <li value="6">If you need to mimic your client AquaticPrime generation and verification, you can paste existing key pairs into the serial number editor for use in the generated license files.</li>
            <li value="7">Order receipts and confirmation e-mails can include or exclude the generated serial number, depending on your settings.</li>
            <li value="8">You can use license files in conjunction with the "Issue serial numbers in ratio to quantity" SKU setting.</li>
            <li value="9">Deferred, bulk generated and manually generated serial numbers do not work in conjunction with license files, so these features are disabled when license files are enabled.</li>
            <li value="10">Two eSellerate variables were added for license files. The new variables can only be used on the receipt page. Their names and descriptions follow:<ul><li value="1">_OrderItem_SNItem.LicenseFileURL – URL to the license file generated for the referenced SKU</li><li value="2">_OrderItem_BundleItem_SNItem.LicenseFileURL – URL to the license file generated for the referenced child SKU</li></ul></li>
            <li value="11">This update involved changes to the Receipt.html file in Custom Layouts. The easiest way to update Custom Layouts for these changes is to create a new layout of the same type as your existing one, download Receipt.htm and then upload the file to the existing layout. Otherwise, if you need to manually edit the receipt page, the steps are as follows:</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Create a new Custom Layout of the same type as your existing layout.</li>
            <li value="2">In the new layout, open Receipt.htm.</li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Locate this line:</p>
                <p>&lt;!-- Checks to see if a OS Platform is assigned to this product. If there is, it will be displayed. --&gt;</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Locate this line:</p>
                <p>&lt;!------ Multi SN ------&gt; (immediately followed by &lt;!-- Show APS Link if deferred --&gt;)</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">Copy everything between the lines noted in steps 3 and 4.</li>
            <li value="6">In the layout needing updated, open Receipt.htm.</li>
            <li value="7">Use the copied text to replace everything between the lines noted in steps 3 and 4.</li>
            <li value="8">Save your changes.</li>
            <li value="9">Go back to the new layout and open Receipt.htm.</li>
            <li value="10">Copy everything between the two &lt;!------ Bundle Multi SN ------&gt; lines.</li>
            <li value="11">In the layout needing updated, open Receipt.htm.</li>
            <li value="12">Use the copied text to replace everything between the two &lt;!------ Bundle Multi SN ------&gt; lines.</li>
            <li value="13">Save your changes.</li>
            <li value="14">Inspect, test and publish your layout.</li>
        </ol>
