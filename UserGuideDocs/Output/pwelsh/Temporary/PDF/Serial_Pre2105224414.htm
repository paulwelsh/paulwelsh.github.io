        <p>With this option, eSellerate issues serial numbers from a list that you provide.<br /><img src="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Output/pwelsh/Temporary/PDF/PDF_1ABAD487/Resources/Images/external_pre.jpg" class="PWimg" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" /></p>
        <h5>To create a Pre-generated serial number set:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">From the<span class="strong"> External Type</span> list, select <span class="strong">Pre-generated</span>.</li>
            <li value="2">When your list is running low, we will notify you via e-mail. (The exception is if you select the Reusable check box, which disables the notification feature.) If you want us to send the notification to the primary contact for your account, leave the <span class="strong">E-mail Notification To</span> field blank. Otherwise, to specify one or more recipient e-mail addresses that we should use instead of the primary contact's address, complete the <span class="strong">E-mail Notification To</span> field. (There is a 50-character limit.) Use commas to separate multiple addresses.</li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Use the <span class="strong">Browse </span>button to select a return-delimited text file of your serial numbers. We will issue serial number for your products from this list.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> Your upload must be a plain text file. The allowable characters are numbers, letters, line feeds, carriage returns, spaces and the following special ASCII characters: ! " # $ % &amp; ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; &lt; &gt; ? @ [ \ ] ^ _ ` { | } ~
<br /><br />The text file should contain at least 500 serial numbers. You should upload more than 500 if you plan to use the serial numbers with SKUs that have "Issue serial numbers in ratio to quantity" enabled.<br /><br />eSellerate does not check for duplicates in pre-generated serial number lists. If you upload duplicate lists or duplicate serial numbers within your lists, we may issue the same serial number more than once. <br /><br />Plain text files created with Apple's TextEdit application are not usable for uploading serial numbers to eSellerate. For that reason, we recommend using other text editors to create your uploads.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> For preview mode testing involving this serial number set, eSellerate will always issue the same pre-generated serial number (typically the first one in the uploaded list).


</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>If you want us to reuse your serial numbers, select the <span class="strong">Reusable</span> check box, and leave the <span class="strong">E-mail Notification To</span> field blank.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> <![CDATA[ ]]>When a pre-generated serial number set runs out, we will reuse the serial numbers to allow sales to continue uninterrupted. This is true even if you have not selected the Reusable check box.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">Click <span class="strong">Save Changes</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Notes on the "&lt;x&gt; serial numbers are available" count</h5>
        <p>After you upload and save a list of pre-generated serial numbers, "&lt;x&gt; serial numbers are available" will appear to the right of the Reusable check box. Information on how eSellerate counts available serial numbers follows.</p>
        <p>To ensure fast and reliable online purchasing, the eSellerate system consists of a number of redundant servers, or "stores." When you upload serial numbers to eSellerate through the Pre-generated serial number option, a portion of those numbers are distributed equally among the various stores. This reduces the available serial number count even before any numbers have been issued. Therefore, it's important to note the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">The Serial Number Set Detail page will often show fewer available serial numbers than you expected. The number listed is actually the number of serial numbers that have not yet been distributed to a store.</li>
            <li value="2">Soon after uploading your serial numbers, you may receive e-mail notification that the list is running low. (Notification is optional.) To avoid receiving this notice unnecessarily, we recommend that you upload at least 500 serial numbers with each new serial number list. You should upload more than 500 if you plan to use the serial numbers with SKUs that have "Issue serial numbers in ratio to quantity" enabled.</li>
        </ul>
