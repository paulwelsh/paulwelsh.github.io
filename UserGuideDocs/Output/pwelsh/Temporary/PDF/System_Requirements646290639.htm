            <MadCap:keyword term="system requirements, eSellerate" />System Requirements</h2>
        <p>The software and hardware required for you to administer eSellerate, and for your customers to purchase through eSellerate, will vary with usage. Specific requirements follow.</p>
        <h3>Managing eSellerate Publisher Accounts</h3>
        <p>To manage your publisher account, you need Internet access, and we recommend using one of the following browsers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.0 or later (Windows)</li>
            <li value="2">Apple Safari 3.0 or later (Macintosh or Windows)</li>
            <li value="3">Mozilla Firefox 3.0 or later (Macintosh or Windows)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, because some functionality of our Sales Manager relies on pop-up windows, we recommend that you always allow pop-ups from our site.</p>
        <h3>
            <MadCap:keyword term="SDKs" />Integrating Applications with eSellerate</h3>
        <p>To sell software directly from your application, you need a development environment such as Xcode for Mac OS or Visual C++ for Windows. You also need the appropriate SDK. The eSellerate Embedded Web Store SDK is available for Macintosh and Windows. </p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span>&#160;The eSellerate (Integrated) SDK is a legacy option that was superseded by the Embedded Web Store SDK. It is not recommended for use with new projects. The Embedded Web Store SDK provides many advanced features that are not available with the legacy option, including fully customizable stores and universal binary support for Macs.</p>
        <p>The Embedded Web Store SDKs are available for downloading through the eSellerate Downloads page. The link for accessing the downloads is on the Sales Manager home page, under the "What's New for eSellerate" information.</p>
        <h3>Purchasing Through eSellerate</h3>
        <p>The system requirements for purchasing through eSellerate will vary according to the eSellers that you use to sell your products. Information on the system requirements for all types of eSellers follows.</p>
