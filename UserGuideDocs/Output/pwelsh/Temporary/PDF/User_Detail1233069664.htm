        <p>The User Detail page is for specifying contact information, login name and permissions for the selected user.</p>
        <p>In the upper portion of the page, you can specify the user's contact information and user name, but not a password. eSellerate generates a password when you save the user details for the first time. (The users can change their assigned passwords later, if they have the required permissions.)</p>
        <p>You can grant permissions for any of the main functional areas shown in the lower portion of the page. All permissions are disabled by default for a new account, with the exception of My Profile. Leaving that permission enabled allows users to manage their own profile information, so they don't have to rely on you or other users to change their passwords or set up their password hints and answers.</p>
        <p>Select the check boxes next to the permissions to enable them. You can also click <span class="strong">All </span>or <span class="strong">none </span>to select or clear entire sections of permissions at once.</p>
        <p>If you are setting up a new account, please note that eSellerate will send the user an e-mail notification as soon as you click <span class="strong">Save User Detail</span>. That notification will use the address from your profile as the "From" address, and will include all the credentials the user needs to log in to the account. It will also include a login link that goes directly to the My Profile page, where the user can change the assigned password if desired, and enter a password hint and answer. </p>
        <p>eSellerate sends the e-mail notification the first time you save the user details, but not for future edits. (The option for resetting passwords involves a different e-mail notification.)</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> Setting certain values on the User Detail page sets the same values on the My Profile page for the selected user, and vise versa. These values are First Name, Last Name, E-mail, Phone Number and Login Name.
