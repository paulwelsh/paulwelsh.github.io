        <p>For your customers that may prefer alternatives to purchasing online, eSellerate supports phone and fax orders. You can use this service to enable phone/fax ordering of the products offered in your eSellerate web store(s). Implementation is as simple as setting one option in the eSellerate Sales Manager and displaying phone and fax order links for your products on your company web site.</p>
        <p>Terms of use for phone/fax orders are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Hours of operation are Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Central Time (excluding American holidays). Fax orders may be sent anytime but will only be processed during normal business hours. Phone orders will only be accepted during normal business hours.</li>
            <li value="2">There is a $20 monthly fee for using eSellerate's phone/fax order service. On the first day of each month, eSellerate will create a $20 negative adjustment to your account balance if you had the phone/fax checkbox enabled for your web store(s) at any time during the previous month.</li>
            <li value="3">All sales will be by credit card and in one of the currencies accepted by eSellerate.<ul><li value="1">Because PayPal users have no way to authenticate their purchases when ordering by phone or fax, eSellerate does not accept that payment method for phone/fax orders.</li></ul></li>
            <li value="4">The supported language for phone/fax orders is English only.</li>
            <li value="5">Publishers using this service waive terms of sale for products sold by phone or fax.</li>
            <li value="6">Shipping is not available for fax orders. Accordingly, the fax order form will exclude SKUs that require shipping. This restriction exists because a customer cannot properly determine shipping costs or shipping options provided by a publisher from a static form.</li>
            <li value="7">Phone/fax order service is not available for private web stores.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>To implement phone/fax orders:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">From the eSeller List page, select a Web Store eSeller and open it for editing.</li>
            <li value="2">Click <span class="strong">Edit eSeller</span>. The Web Store eSeller Detail page appears.</li>
            <li value="3">Select the <span class="strong">Enable Phone and Fax Orders</span> check box. Two URLs will display—one for fax and one for phone order forms.<br /><img src="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Output/pwelsh/Temporary/PDF/PDF_1ABAD487/Resources/Images/web_eseller_detail.jpg" class="PWimg" /></li>
            <li value="4">Copy either or both of the URLs for use in your company web site. These URLs will allow you to provide the respective order options for your customers.</li>
            <li value="5">Click <span class="strong">Save Changes</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>An overview of the purchase process follows:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">A customer clicks a link on your company web site to enact one of the following purchase options: <ul><li value="1">Phone order</li><li value="2">Fax order</li></ul></li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>A web page displays all active SKUs in your web store, along with pricing in U.S. dollars and short descriptions. (This excludes hidden SKUs, which only display as cross-sell items. Also, fax order pages exclude SKUs that require shipping.)</p>

            <li value="3">The customer places an order in one of these ways: <ul><li value="1">For a phone order, the customer calls and provides order information to an     <![CDATA[ ]]>eSellerate representative.</li><li value="2">For a fax order, the customer types in most of the order information directly.
