        <h1>Available Products</h1>
        <p>This page lists all the products available for you to sell as a member of the eSellerate Affiliate program. Products are listed by category for quick browsing, or you can use the provided search functions to further narrow your choices. </p>
        <h3>About the Search Functions
</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Simple Search (the default) allows searching by platform, and can also find matches for product title, product short description and publisher name. (To include product short description in the search — which will delay the results — you'll need to check the box provided.)</li>
            <li>Advanced Search provides access to additional search criteria such as category, commission and price, and allows filtering by the available options for selling the products. It can also sort results by product title, price or commission rate.</li>
            <li>Both search functions can perform "Starts with" or "Contains" searches. "Starts with" searches are the faster option, but "Contains" searches typically provide broader results.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Understanding the Product Information</h3>
        <p>When you locate a product either by searching or by clicking into its parent category, the following information will be displayed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Title and short description</li>
            <li>Availability, which refers to the available options for selling the product</li>
            <li>Product price</li>
            <li>Percentage of the price you would earn as commission for selling the product</li>
            <li>A "more info…" link</li>
            <li>A "Sell this product" link</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Click the "more info…" link if you just want to learn about the product. You will then be able to sign up to sell the product if you choose to do so.</p>
        <p>Click the "Sell this product" link if you have already checked out the product and are ready to sign up to sell it.</p>
        <p>Either link will take you to the <MadCap:xref href="Product_Detail/Product_Detail.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Product Detail</MadCap:xref> page.</p>
