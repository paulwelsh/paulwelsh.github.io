        <h2>My Products</h2>
        <p>The My Products page provides access to all the products you have signed up to sell, along with information such as price, commission rate and whether the product is eST enabled. You can use this page to do any of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#searchby">Search</a> for products</li>
            <li><a href="#exportmyprod">Export</a> your "My Products" data as XML</li>
            <li><a href="#sortprod">Sort</a> product lists</li>
            <li><a href="#categprod">Categorize</a> products by relevance</li>
            <li><a href="#accessdetails">Access</a> product details</li>
            <li><a href="#deleteprod">Delete</a> products from your account</li>
        </ul>
        <p>More details on the functions provided by the My Products page follow.</p>
        <h3><a name="searchby"></a>Searching for Products</h3>
        <p>The top portion of the page provides a number of ways to search for products. You can use criteria such as publisher, category, commission and status, and filter the results by the available options for selling the products, such as Purchase Link and Downloadable eST File.</p>
        <h3><a name="exportmyprod"></a>Exporting Your "My Products" Data as XML</h3>
        <p>One way to find information about the products you have signed up to sell is to navigate to the Product Detail page of each product, as explained below in <a href="#accessdetails">Accessing Product Details</a>. As an alternative to this method, you can export your "My Products" data as XML. For details, see <MadCap:xref href="My_Products_Export.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Exporting "My Products" Data</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> <![CDATA[ ]]>In addition to the export option noted above, you can use a <a href="My_Products_Web_Service.htm">web service</a> to get your latest "My Products" data in XML format.    <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <h3><a name="sortprod"></a>Sorting Product Lists</h3>
        <p>By default, the page lists products by SKU name in alphabetical, ascending order. To list products by a different criterion, click the appropriate table heading, such as Publisher Name, Price or Commission. Click the same heading a second time to change to descending order if desired.</p>
        <h3><a name="categprod"></a>Categorizing Products by Relevance</h3>
        <p>Each product listed in My Products has either Primary or Secondary relevance. The relevance setting allows you to categorize products for list purposes. It has no other effect on the SKUs. </p>
        <p>The way that you sign up to sell a product determines the product's default relevance. The differences are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you sign up to sell a product by clicking the "Sell this product" link or the "Sell This Product" button, the product will have Primary relevance. </li>
            <li>To sign up to sell all of a publisher's products, you must go to the Product Detail page of one of the products and click the "Sell All Products" button. In this case, the product featured on the Product Detail page will have Primary relevance, and all current and future products from the publisher will have Secondary relevance.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>To change product relevance:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Do one of the following to select the desired product(s): <ul><li>To select individual products, check the box to the left of the product.</li><li>To select all products on the page, check the box in the table heading.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Do one of the following to select the desired relevance: <ul><li>To change product relevance to Primary, click <span class="strong">Make Primary</span>. </li><li>To change product relevance to Secondary, click <span class="strong">Make Secondary</span>.</li></ul></li>
            <li>When the confirmation dialog displays, click <span class="strong">OK</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> You can only change relevance of products on the currently displayed page.</p>
        <h3><a name="accessdetails"></a>Accessing Product Details</h3>
