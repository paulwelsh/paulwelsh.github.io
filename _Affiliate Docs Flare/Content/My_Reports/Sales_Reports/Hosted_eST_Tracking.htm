        <h1>Hosted eST Tracking</h1>
        <p>You can use this report to gauge the effectiveness of your marketing campaigns based on factors such as the number of Hosted eST downloads and Landing Page visits.</p>
        <h5>Notes:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>This report does not provide statistics for Downloadable eST files.</li>
            <li>The date range for this report is based on the dates of Landing Page visits and downloads. Because sales can occur on different dates than the initial visits, it is difficult to accurately match visits to sales.</li>
            <li> The Visits figure refers to visits to Landing Pages. eSellerate records one visit per session.</li>
            <li>The Downloads figure refers to successful downloads of Hosted eST files. These downloads can be from a Landing Page, or a direct link to the Hosted eST files. Also note:<ul><li>If a line item includes one or more downloads and a Landing Page, then the downloads were from the specified Landing Page.</li><li>If a line item includes one or more downloads but no Landing Page, then the downloads were from a direct link to the Hosted eST file.</li></ul></li>
            <li>The Visits to DL figure refers to the percentage of Landing Page visits that resulted in downloads.</li>
            <li>The DL to Sales figure refers to the percentage of downloads that resulted in sales.</li>
            <li>The Visits to Sales figure refers to the percentage of Landing Page visits that resulted in sales.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>To run a Hosted eST Tracking report:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>If you would like to narrow the scope of your report to specific items such as one SKU or one tracking ID, make your selections from the popmenus provided.</li>
            <li>The popmenus to the right of <span class="strong">Group By</span> are for controlling what displays in the first two columns of this report. Use the first popmenu to set the first column, and the second popmenu to set the second column.</li>
            <li>If you would like your report to find statistics within a specific date range, make your selection from the <span class="strong">Date Range</span> popmenu. You can also edit or enter dates in the From and To fields.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="strong">Run</span>. The table will display all statistics that matched your report criteria.</li>
            <li>Click any of the underlined column headings to sort your results by that criterion. You can then click the heading a second time to switch the sorting between ascending order and descending order.</li>
