        <ol>
            <li>If a "Sell This Product" button displays, click it to proceed. Otherwise, skip to step 3.</li>
            <li>If the publisher requires a one-time approval to sell its products and you have not yet submitted a request, follow the instructions provided to do so. (Otherwise, skip to step 3.) Until the publisher either grants or denies approval to sell, any of its products that you sign up to sell will be added to your My Products listing with a Pending status.
