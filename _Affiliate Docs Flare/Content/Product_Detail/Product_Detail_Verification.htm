        <h2>Verifying Affiliate Sales Credit</h2>
        <p>There are several ways to verify that you will receive credit for the sales you make as an eSellerate affiliate. The verification methods vary according to the sales method.</p>
        <h5>If you sell products through "Buy" links on your affiliate web site, do the following to verify affiliate sales credit:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Click one of the "Buy" links to initiate a purchase.</li>
            <li>At any point in the session, enter the following URL:<br />http://store.esellerate.net/Store/ShowSession.aspx</li>
        </ol>
        <p>A page similar to the one below displays session information, including your affiliate ID.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/show_session.gif" />
        </p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> It's possible that the URL referenced in step 2 above will return a "Page Not Found" error. In that case, click your browser's Back button and note the number that immediately follows "http://store" in the page address. Enter the URL from step 2 again, but this time insert the store number, as in the following example: http://store2.esellerate.net/Store/ShowSession.aspx</p>
        <h5>If you sell products through "Try" links on your affiliate web site, do the following to verify affiliate sales credit (Windows systems only):</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to the Product Detail page of one of the products you sell through a "Try" link.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="strong">eST</span>. The eST tab displays.</li>
            <li>Download the eST version of the product.</li>
            <li>Close or minimize your browser.</li>
            <li>Launch the eST download.</li>
            <li>Initiate a purchase from within the software.</li>
            <li>For an interface similar to the one below, click <span class="strong">Start</span>. <p><img src="../Resources/Images/delivery_wizard.gif" /></p><ul><li>At any screen you choose, press <span class="strong">Control+Shift</span> and click on the "Powered by eSellerate" logo. In the dialog that displays, the webstoreURL field should include your affiliate ID. (It is correct behavior for the affiliateID field to be blank.)</li></ul><p><img src="../Resources/Images/delivery_wizard2.gif" /></p></li>
            <li>For an interface displayed in a browser window such as the one below, press <span class="strong">Control+Shift</span> and click on the globe in the browser status bar. In the dialog that displays, the webstoreURL field should include your affiliate ID. (It is correct behavior for the affiliateID field to be blank.) <p><img src="../Resources/Images/ews.gif" /></p></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> If the product that you offer through "Try" links on your affiliate web site is a custom build from the publisher, rather than an eST download, you can follow steps 5 through 8 above to verify affiliate sales credit. Because custom builds typically send affiliate ID to the eSellerate servers through API calls, the information displayed when you follow steps 7 or 8 will probably differ from the examples. In this case, the affiliateID field should display your affiliate ID, and the webstoreURL field should be blank. If both fields contain information and the information differs, the affiliateID field has precedence.</p>
