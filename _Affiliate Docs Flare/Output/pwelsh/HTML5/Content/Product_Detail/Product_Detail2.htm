        <h2>Product Detail Part 2</h2>
        <h5><a name="indprod"></a>If you want to sell the individual product, do the following:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">If a "Sell This Product" button displays, click it to proceed. Otherwise, skip to step 3.</li>
            <li value="2">If the publisher requires a one-time approval to sell its products and you have not yet submitted a request, follow the instructions provided to do so. (Otherwise, skip to step 3.) Until the publisher either grants or denies approval to sell, any of its products that you sign up to sell will be added to your My Products listing with a Pending status. If the publisher grants approval to sell, any of its products that you signed up to sell will change to an Active status. When you select one of these products from your My Products listing and return to its Product Detail page, you will be able to begin with step 3 below.</li>
            <li value="3">Assuming you have any required approval to sell the publisher's products, the product for this Product Detail page will be added to your My Products listing with an Active status. Follow the instructions provided in the Purchase Links, Landing Pages and eST tabs to begin selling the product. </li>
        </ol>
        <h5><a name="allprod"></a>If you want to sell all of the publisher's products, do the following:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Click the "Sell All Products" button.</li>
            <li value="2">If the publisher requires a one-time approval to sell its products and you have not yet submitted a request, follow the instructions provided to do so.

            <li value="3">Assuming you have any required approval to sell the publisher's products, all current and future products that the publisher offers for affiliate sale will be added to your My Products listing with an Active status. (You will receive e-mail notification for each automatic sign-up that occurs after the initial sign-up.) You will need to go to the Product Detail page for each product and follow the instructions provided in the Purchase Links, Landing Pages and eST tabs to begin selling the products.</li>
