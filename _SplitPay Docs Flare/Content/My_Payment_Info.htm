        <h1>My Payment Info</h1>
        <p>This page is for entering your payment information if it's available. You are not required to enter payment information to begin using the SplitPay program. Until you enter this information, you will see the following reminder each time you log in to the system:</p>
        <p>"You must complete the My Payment Information section before eSellerate can pay you for SplitPay product sales. If you prefer to enter this information later, you may click Continue."</p>
        <h3>Funds Transfer Options</h3>
        <p>There are two options for receiving your SplitPay funds:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you are a licensed eSellerate publisher, eSellerate can transfer the funds to your publisher account. To use this option, select the appropriate radio button and enter your publisher ID (the "PUB…" ID on the eSellerate Sales Manager home page) in the field provided. Then click <span class="strong">Save Changes</span>. If setup is successful, your company name will appear to the right of the Publisher ID field. (You can skip the rest of the payment documentation that follows.)</li>
            <li>eSellerate can transfer the funds to a bank account that you specify here at the My Payment Info page. To use this option, select the appropriate radio button and enter your payment information as described below.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Payment Methods</h4>
        <p>All payments will be in U.S. dollars. Depending on your country of origin as specified at the My Account page, eSellerate will send your payments by direct deposit via one of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Automated Clearing House (ACH) – This is your payment type if you are located in the United States. The service is free of charge between U.S. banks.</li>
            <li>International ACH – This is your payment type if you are located in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand or the United Kingdom. There is no charge to you for these payments.</li>
            <li>International wire transfer – This is your payment type if you are located in a country other than the ones listed above. There is a $15 fee per payment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your payment type will be noted above bank name on the My Payment Info page.</p>
        <p>For detailed payment information, see the Compensation section of the SplitPay Agreement, which you can access anytime through a link on the My Account page.</p>
