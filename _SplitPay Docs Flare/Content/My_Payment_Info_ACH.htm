        <h1>ACH</h1>
        <p>The My Payment Info page is for entering your payment information if it's available. You are not required to enter payment information to begin using the SplitPay program. Until you enter this information, you will see the following reminder each time you log in to the system:</p>
        <p>"You must complete the My Payment Information section before eSellerate can pay you for SplitPay product sales. If you prefer to enter this information later, you may click Continue."</p>
        <h3>Entering Payment Information for ACH</h3>
        <p>If your payment type is ACH, you will need to specify the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#bankinfo">Bank Information</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="#beneficiary">Beneficiary Bank Information</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a name="bankinfo"></a>Bank Information
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Bank name</li>
            <li>Account type (checking or savings)</li>
            <li>Routing number</li>
            <li>Account number</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This information will be available on a check from the bank account you choose for receiving the ACH payments. For help in locating the routing number and account number on your check, see the instructions below.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/blankcheck_us.gif" />
        </p>
        <p>The routing number and account number are located at the bottom of the check. While the position of the account number on your check may vary from the example above, you can locate the number through the process of elimination. Start by locating the routing number, which is the nine-digit number between the <img src="Resources/Images/bankrtsymbol.gif" /> symbols. Then eliminate the check number, which will correspond with the number in the upper-right corner of your check. (Check number is not needed for your payment setup.) The remaining number will be the account number.</p>
        <h4><a name="beneficiary"></a>Beneficiary Bank Information
        </h4>
        <p>This section provides additional information about the bank and the account that you have designated for receiving your ACH payments. The one required entry is account holder name, which is the name of the person or entity (such as a company) on file with the bank as the account holder. The remaining entries are optional, and include address and phone information for the bank that you have designated for receiving your ACH payments. </p>
