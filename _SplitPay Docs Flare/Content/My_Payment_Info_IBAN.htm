        <h1>IBAN</h1>
        <p>International Bank Account Number (IBAN) is a standard way of uniquely identifying an account for the purpose of improving the efficiency and speed of cross-border payments. When a cross-border payment is made in Europe, an IBAN is used to identify the account to which the payment should be made.</p>
        <p>eSellerate needs to collect your IBAN if your payment type is international ACH or international wire, and you are located in one of these countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cypress, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia or the United Kingdom.</p>
        <p>Your bank will need to provide you with your IBAN. You can then enter your IBAN on the My Payment Info page, in the Account Number field (which is located under "Bank Information").</p>
        <p>The structure and number of digits for IBAN varies by country. If you are interested in seeing some examples, there are a number of online sources available through a search. You can also refer to <a href="My_Payment_Info_IBAN_Examples.htm">these</a> examples.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> Some online sources provide details on how to calculate IBAN. You do not need to perform these calculations yourself. Your bank will provide your IBAN in its complete form.</p>
