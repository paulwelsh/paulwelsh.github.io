        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> The information that is available through this report does not include your profit or eSellerate's commission on your orders from 4/1/2011 and later. To find that information and more, please use <a href="Business_Intel_Reports.htm">Business Navigator reports</a>.</p>
        <p>This report shows details on your previous payments. </p>
        <h5>To access Payment History report information: </h5>
        <ol>
            <li>For more information about a specific payment, click its <span class="strong">Payment ID</span> field. The resulting page will include a publisher sales summary and a listing of any adjustment items. </li>
            <li>For more payment details, use one of the following Payment Transaction Ledger options: <ul><li>Click <span class="strong">View </span>to see the results in an HTML table. </li><li>Click <span class="strong">Export (CSV)</span> to export the results as a comma-delimited file.</li></ul></li>
        </ol>
        <h5>If you selected View: </h5>
        <p>The table will display all transactions involved in this payment.</p>
        <h5>If you selected Export (CSV): </h5>
        <p>The resulting Save As dialog will display a default file name, which you can change if desired. In any case, you will need to change the file extension to ".csv" before saving the file (applies to both Windows and Macintosh platforms). </p>
        <p>You can now import the file into a database, or open it in a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel. (If a program prompts you to specify a format for this data, select comma-delimited or comma-separated values.) </p>
