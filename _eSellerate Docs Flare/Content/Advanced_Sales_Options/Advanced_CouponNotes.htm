        <ul>
            <li>In contrast to all other SKUs, coupon discounts do not apply to the  eSellerate Download Protection (eDP) SKU amount.</li>
            <li>Coupon discounts always apply as a negative adjustment to the entire order amount (minus the eDP SKU amount when applicable), in the same way that shipping is a positive adjustment to the order.</li>
            <li><MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> will first apply any cross-sell, up-sell and volume discounts to individual order items, and then apply coupon discounts to the entire order amount (minus the eDP SKU amount when applicable).</li>
            <li>Sales tax is based on the subtotal after the coupon discount, not including shipping.</li>
            <li>eSellerate affiliate commissions and <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> fees are reduced proportionally (prorated) by the coupon discount amount.</li>
            <li>Only one coupon is allowed per order.</li>
            <li>A coupon with usage limitations is considered used even if the order is returned or voided.</li>
            <li>When processing order returns, you can return all or part of the coupon discount.</li>
            <li>Coupons can be generated for specific sales partners.</li>
            <li>A coupon can have one of three statuses: <ul><li>Preview — set up but not activated for use</li><li>Active — set up and activated for use</li><li>Inactive — manually deactivated</li></ul></li>
            <li>Coupons can be deactivated.</li>
            <li>Coupons with either Preview or Active status can be used in preview testing.</li>
            <li>Coupons are valid for private web stores.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="pwNote"><a name="coupondiscountnote"></a><span class="strong">Important:</span> Make sure that your coupon discounts do not result in order totals that are greater than $0 and less than $1. Because payment processors cannot process transactions for amounts less than $1, a coupon discount that reduces the order total to less than $1 will force <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> to provide the product for free. Publishers accept complete responsibility for the setup and implementation of their coupons to prevent this occurrence.</p>
