        <p>After you activate a one-time use coupon, its Coupon Details page will allow you to generate a text file containing coupon IDs. </p>
        <p>Enter the number of coupons needed and click <span class="strong">Generate</span>. The resulting Save As dialog will display a default file name, which you can change if desired. You can also change the file extension to another text format (such as ".txt") before saving the file.</p>
