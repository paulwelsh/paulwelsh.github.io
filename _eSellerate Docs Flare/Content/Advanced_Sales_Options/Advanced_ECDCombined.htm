        <p>When eCD orders combine Macintosh and Windows eCD files, each file will each be placed in its own subdirectory on the CD, and an autorun HTML menu of the CD contents will be automatically created. On Windows systems, the user will be able to click an "Install" button in the menu to open the corresponding file. The autorun functionality will only be available on Windows.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> When eCD files are disk images, they will never be combined with other files on a CD as described here. This is because each disk image file requires its own CD.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note</span>: When the CD is viewed on Mac OS 9, long file names will be truncated to the short 8.3 format.<br /></p>
