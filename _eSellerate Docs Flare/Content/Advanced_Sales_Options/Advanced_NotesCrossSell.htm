        <h2>Notes on Cross-Selling</h2>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print,Primary.Online">Integrated eSellers</h3>
        <ul MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print,Primary.Online">
            <li>The maximum quantity for cross-sell SKU purchases is one.</li>
            <li>Cross-sell SKUs will display with the image and Short Description designated for them on the Basic tab of the SKU Detail page, when applicable. </li>
            <li>Integrated eSellers can require the customer to agree to one set of terms during a purchase. Depending on your settings, these terms can be either of the following: <ul><li>Any terms you choose to enter for the eSeller at the eSeller Summary level</li><li>Terms of sale for the primary SKU</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print,Primary.Online">Web Store and Embedded Web Store eSellers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Each cross-sell SKU has its own setting for controlling the quantities that customers can purchase. That setting is available at the Cross-Sell SKU Detail level.</li>
            <li>Cross-sell SKUs will display with the image and Short Description designated for them on the Basic tab of the SKU Detail page, when applicable. </li>
            <li>Before adding a SKU to the shopping cart, the customer must agree to any associated terms of sale. </li>
            <li>Multiple cross-sell SKU groups can display when appropriate. </li>
            <li>A cross-sell SKU can display in multiple SKU groups if it uses the same pricing in all instances. Otherwise, only the lowest price instance will display. </li>
            <li>Once a cross-sell SKU has been purchased at regular price, no discount price will display. </li>
            <li>A cross-sell SKU can offer its own cross-sell SKU group. If this cross-sell SKU is purchased at a discount, its cross-sell SKU group will not display. </li>
            <li>Removal of one SKU from the shopping cart can require the removal of other SKUs. A SKU that has no cross-sell relationship with the SKU being removed will remain in the cart. Otherwise, for the SKUs whose purchase was based on the SKU being removed, the following rules apply: <ul><li>Remove discounted SKUs.</li><li>Remove SKUs if the primary SKU was hidden (shown only as a cross-sell item).</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
