        <p>This option allows you to provide a product or service according to a subscription model.</p>
        <h4 MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print,Primary.Online">Availability</h4>
        <ul MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print,Primary.Online">
            <li>Subscriptions are an option for Web Store eSellers (with Custom Layouts or Standard Layouts) and Embedded Web Store eSellers only.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Subscription Settings</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> You determine how often your customers are billed for the subscriptions, with billing frequencies (in days, weeks, months or years) ranging from 7 days to 3 years. You also determine the number of billings, which can be unlimited ("until cancellation") or a set number. The duration, which is the period of time the subscription service is available before it requires a renewal, cannot exceed 3 years/36 months.</li>
            <li>The count for number of billings includes the initial purchase. </li>
            <li>There are two types of renewal policies: <ul><li>Automatic renewal – The subscription renews automatically at the end of the set duration, unless the customer cancels. No action is required on the part of a customer wishing to renew. </li><li>Manual renewal – The customer must take action to renew the subscription, or else it expires at the end of the set duration. </li></ul></li>
            <li>For both types of renewal policies, billings can occur throughout the duration, according to the subscription settings. For example, if the billing frequency is every 1 month and the number of billings is 12, there will be a charge to the customer's payment method for the initial purchase, followed by a charge every month for the next 11 months. This billing process repeats for each renewal. </li>
            <li>There are no recurring billings during the duration of "until cancellation" subscriptions, because those subscriptions renew with each billing. (They're basically equivalent to setting number of billings to 1, and the renewal policy to automatic renewal.)</li>
            <li>You have the option to generate a new serial number for renewals, when applicable to the subscription SKU. </li>
            <li>If you would like your customers to be able to use their subscriptions for a set period of time after the expiration, you can set a grace period of up to 99 days. (Grace period applies to manual renewals only.) </li>
            <li>If you set up a subscription to allow changing the quantity, your customers will be able to increase or decrease the quantity at any time while the subscription is active. For more information, including details on how <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> adjusts the charges for a change of quantity, please see <MadCap:xref href="Advanced_SubQty.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Allowing Change of Quantity</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>Once you activate a subscription method, you cannot edit it. You do have the option to change the subscription method and pricing for a given SKU, but this will not affect existing subscriptions until renewal time. The renewal reminder e-mail will show customers their current subscription information, followed by information about the renewal. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>SKU Settings</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Once you have set up a subscription method, you can assign it to a SKU. The option for assigning a subscription method is available on the Advanced tab of the SKU Detail page. </li>
            <li>You can specify the SKUs that are offered to the customer at the subscription renewal. This may include setting the default SKU, which is the SKU that will be used for automatic renewals if the customer does not choose a different one. Renewal options are set on the Renewal tab of the SKU Detail page.</li>
            <li>Subscription pricing is determined by the price of the SKU using the subscription. Each subscription billing is for the full SKU price, plus additional charges as needed for shipping, taxes and eCD.</li>
            <li>The price for a subscription SKU can be $0, or $4.95 USD or greater.                      <![CDATA[ ]]></li>
            <li>Customers are required to enter their payment information when ordering $0 subscription SKUs. Having that payment information on record allows <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> to charge the customers when they choose different (greater than $0) SKUs for automatic renewals.</li>
            <li>As with anything that you sell through <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" />, you can set pricing for subscriptions in non-USD currencies by using the Native Currency Pricing (NCP) option.</li>
            <li>Subscription SKUs can allow multi-quantity sales. </li>
            <li>Shipping is allowed in conjunction with subscription SKUs. Publishers will receive a notice of shipping requirements for each billing that occurs during the subscription duration. (See also the information about subscription start dates, at the end of these notes.)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>eSeller SKUs</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>When you add a subscription SKU to an eSeller, be sure to also add all the additional SKUs that you are going to be offering at subscription renewal. This would be all the SKUs listed on the SKU's Renewal tab, in the SKUs Offered at Subscription Renewal section.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print,Primary.Online">License Enforcement</h4>
        <ul MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print,Primary.Online">
            <li>You can use <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> Product Activation to restrict subscription usage to current subscribers only. For example, you can use the ActivateSerialNumber API to activate a serial number for a new subscription, and reactivate/verify activation on a regular basis. (There are no special activation calls related to subscriptions. The standard calls can be applied to subscription models.) </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Payment Options</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Payment is by credit card, PayPal or e-check (ACH).     In special circumstances, payment can also be by purchase order or international wire. These special circumstances are when the following conditions are true for all subscriptions in the shopping cart:<ul><li>The renewal policy is manual renewal.</li><li>The duration and billing frequency are such that no recurring billings occur during the duration of the subscription. For example, if the duration is 12 months, the billing frequency must be every 12 months so there are no charges other than at the beginning of the subscription period, and optionally at the end of the period, if the customer manually renews.</li></ul></li>
            <li>When payment is by purchase order or international wire, the orders start out in a pending state—customers don't receive serial numbers or download links at the time of purchase. Customers are granted access to all their order items after the purchase order is received and approved, or the wire payment is received. (See also the information about subscription start dates, at the end of these notes.) </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Custom Layouts</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>eSellerate variables used in default Custom Layouts to enable subscription functionality include: <ul><li>_Cart.IsCreditCardRequired – Boolean that will be true if the shopping cart contains at least one SKU that requires the customer to enter payment information </li><li>_Cart.HasSubscriptionSku – Boolean that will be true if the shopping cart contains at least one subscription SKU </li><li>_Sku.TermsOfSubscriptionText – String containing the subscription terms and conditions text for the selected SKU </li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Subscription Orders</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> provides a number of automatic notifications to keep customers informed of the status of their subscriptions. These notifications include renewal reminders sent prior to expiration, expiration notices sent after expiration (manual renewals only) and reminders of each billing that occurs during the subscription duration. </li>
            <li>Customers manage their subscriptions through the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> After-Purchase Services web site (<a><a href="http://store.esellerate.net/support" target="_blank">http://store.esellerate.net/support</a></a>), where they can update their billing information, renew or cancel subscriptions, and change  subscription quantities (if you allow such changes). Customers purchasing a renewal may have the option to choose the same SKU and subscription, a different SKU and subscription, or a non-subscription SKU. They also can choose to have their renewal choice take effect right away, or at the next scheduled billing (to make full use of the time already purchased for the current subscription). </li>
            <li>When a subscription is canceled through After-Purchase Services, <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> sends an e-mail notification to the publisher and the customer. We include you (the publisher) in these notifications to keep you informed when your customers cancel their subscriptions themselves.</li>
            <li>After-Purchase Services does not allow customers to change their shipping address for subscriptions, because a different address could affect the pre-defined shipping charges. </li>
            <li>When customers update their credit card information through After-Purchase Services, the following message is displayed: "NOTE: To verify the credit card that you just provided, we have placed an authorization on the card. Your credit card billing will show an authorization from WWW.ESLR8.COM in the amount of &lt;price&gt;, which is the base price of &lt;product&gt;. This authorization is not a charge to your card, and it will eventually expire. The length of time before an authorization expires depends on the policy of the issuing bank."                               <![CDATA[ ]]></li>
            <li>If a notification is returned as undeliverable, <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> will place the subscription in a suspended status, and notify you via e-mail. It is then your responsibility to contact the customer to obtain a valid e-mail address, and update the subscription information. </li>
            <li>Customers purchasing a subscription must agree to subscription terms and conditions, which are separate from any terms of sale that might apply. <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> sets the subscription terms and conditions. You have the option to provide additional text to accompany the pre-defined content. </li>
            <li>Coupons apply to the initial subscription purchase only. The coupon discounts do not affect billings that occur during the duration of the subscription. </li>
            <li>There can be instances in which payment information is required even when a coupon reduces the subscription price to $0. Payment information is required whenever there will be future billings, such as for an automatic renewal.                          <![CDATA[ ]]></li>
            <li>In the case of affiliate sales, affiliates receive credit for the initial subscription purchase and all billings that occur during the first duration. Affiliates do not receive credit for subscription renewals. </li>
            <li>SplitPay payees receive credit for every subscription billing, including renewals and subsequent durations. The payees will receive credit as long as the subscription SKU remains set up for split payments. </li>
            <li>Each billing during the duration of a subscription will have its own order ID. These IDs will be associated with the original order ID for reporting purposes. </li>
            <li>The following e-mail notifications include subscription information when applicable: <ul><li>Order Confirmation e-mail sent to the customer </li><li><MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> Order Notice e-mail sent to the addresses specified for the per-transaction report (available through Account Information)</li><li>The automated daily summary report file (available through Account Information)</li></ul></li>
            <li>Information on sales reports that include subscription information follows: <ul><li>The SKU Sales by Date Range report can filter results by subscription. </li><li>The SKU Sales Summary report shows the number of new subscriptions, frequency billings and renewals for the selected SKU.</li><li>The Subscription SKU Sales Summary report shows sales by count or U.S. dollar amount, with the results broken down by year, quarter, or month.</li><li>The Daily Summary Export includes columns for subscription ID and subscription status.</li></ul></li>
            <li>The Order Detail page lists subscription information when applicable.</li>
            <li>You can use preview orders to test various subscription events, such as e-mail notifications and XML posts for subscription changes. The options for testing subscription events are available on the Order Detail page when it's showing preview orders that involved subscriptions.</li>
            <li>The XML order notice (available through Account Information) lists subscription information when applicable for new orders, and provides individual posts for changes in subscription status.</li>
            <li>The possible statuses for subscriptions are ACTIVE, CANCELED, EXPIRED, PENDING CANCELATION, RENEWAL FAILED, RENEWED, SUSPENDED EXPIRED and SUSPENDED FAILED BILLING.</li>
            <li>Subscription services begin on the date of the initial purchase (with the exception noted below). The purchase date determines the renewal date, unless the purchase is on day 29, 30 or 31 of a given month, in which case the renewal date will be the first day of the next month.<ul><li>The above statement is true even when payment is by purchase order or international wire.</li><li>When a customer purchases a subscription SKU that requires shipping, <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> waits to create a subscription record until you have marked the order as fulfilled. Therefore, the fulfillment date will determine the subscription start date.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
