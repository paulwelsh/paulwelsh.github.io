        <p><MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> subscriptions provide another way for you to sell your software, by giving your customers a choice between a one-time purchase and recurring billings. You determine how often your customers are billed for the subscriptions, with billing frequencies (in days, weeks, months or years) ranging from 7 days to 3 years. You also determine the number of billings, which can be unlimited ("until cancellation") or a set number. The duration, which is the period of time the subscription service is available before it requires a renewal, cannot exceed 3 years/36 months.</p>
        <p>Renewals come due at the end the predetermined number of billings. A renewal can be automatic, so that the customer doesn't have to do anything to start another subscription term, or manual, so that the customer must take action to renew the subscription, or else it expires.</p>
        <p>Depending on how you set up your renewal options, your customers may be able to renew into the same subscription, start a different subscription, or purchase a non-subscription SKU for a lump sum.</p>
        <p>To start selling a product or service through a subscription model, you will first create a subscription method. This involves setting billing frequency, number of billings and renewal policy. An example is a subscription billed monthly for 12 months, and using an automatic renewal policy, which means the subscription renews automatically at the end of the duration unless the customer cancels. Other options for the subscription method include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Generating a serial number for each renewal</li>
            <li>Allowing customers to change the quantities of active subscriptions</li>
            <li> Adding your own text to accompany the subscription terms and conditions that your online stores will display for the subscription</li>
            <li> Providing text for the renewal reminder e-mails to promote up-sells from subscriptions that are trials</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you have set up the subscription method, you can assign it to a SKU. You will need to make sure that the SKU name and description clearly represent the SKU to your customers as a subscription. You will also need to set pricing. Each subscription billing will be for the full SKU price, plus additional charges as needed for shipping, taxes and eCD. Another consideration is your method of restricting subscription usage to current subscribers only. (We suggest using <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> Product Activation.)  Finally, you can specify the SKUs that are offered to the customer at the subscription renewal. This may include setting the default SKU, which is the SKU that will be used for automatic renewals if the customer does not choose a different one.</p>
        <p>You can sell the subscription SKU through any of your Web Store or Embedded Web Store eSellers. When customers select the SKU for purchasing, they will need to agree to the subscription terms and conditions. The customer will be charged for the initial purchase, and then automatic charges can occur during the duration, according to the predetermined number of billings. These billings during the duration are known as recurring or frequency billings. There are no recurring billings for "until cancellation" subscriptions, because those subscriptions renew with each billing. (They're basically equivalent to setting number of billings to 1, and the renewal policy to automatic renewal.)</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> will send notifications to the customer for various subscription events. These notifications include renewal reminders sent prior to expiration, expiration notices sent after expiration (manual renewals only) and reminders of each billing that occurs during the subscription duration.</p>
        <p>Your customers will manage their subscriptions through the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> After-Purchase Services web site (<a><a href="http://store.esellerate.net/support" target="_blank">http://store.esellerate.net/support</a></a>), where they can update their billing information, renew or cancel subscriptions, and change  subscription quantities (if you allow such changes). Customers purchasing a renewal may have the option to choose the same SKU and subscription, a different SKU and subscription, or a non-subscription SKU. They also can choose to have their renewal choice take effect right away, or at the next scheduled billing (to make full use of the time already purchased for the current subscription). </p>
        <p>If the customer cancels a subscription or lets it expire (manual renewals only), <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> updates the subscription status to either canceled or expired, and deactivates the serial number associated with that subscription. Assuming you have set up your product to periodically verify subscription status, the customer should no longer be able to access the subscription services. (For a cancellation, <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> waits until the end of the current billing period before updating the subscription status to canceled, and deactivating the associated serial number.)</p>
