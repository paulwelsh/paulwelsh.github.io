        <p>The E-mails tab of the Subscription Detail page provides links that you can click to view sample content for the e-mail notifications listed. These samples do not reflect any actual settings for the selected subscription method.</p>
        <p>The samples for renewal reminders and expiration notices represent the automatic notifications that <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> sends to customers for certain subscription events. The "7 day" notifications are required (except with "until cancellation" subscriptions), and the others are optional. For more information on these notifications, see <MadCap:xref href="Advanced_SubDetails.htm#AdvancedSalesOptions_3786514807_271012">Subscriptions: Details</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>You can also view samples of the notifications <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> sends to customers for certain billing topics. These samples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pre-Frequency Billing – When a subscription has billing frequencies that occur within the duration, such as monthly billings for a 12-month duration, <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> sends reminders to the customers seven days in advance of each billing. </li>
            <li>CC Expiration Notice – When a credit card on file for charging a subscription is about to expire, <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> notifies the customer (30 days in advance) and provides instructions on how to update the credit card information through <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> After-Purchase Services. </li>
            <li>Billing Failed Notice – When a billing for a subscription fails because of issues with the payment method, <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> notifies the customer and provides instructions on how to update the payment method information through <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> After-Purchase Services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> You can use preview orders to test these e-mail notifications. If you're viewing a preview order that involved subscriptions, the Order Detail page will provide options for testing these e-mails and other subscription events.
