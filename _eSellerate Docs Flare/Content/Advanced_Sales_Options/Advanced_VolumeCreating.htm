        <h2>Creating Volume Discount Sets</h2>
        <h5>To create a volume discount set:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the <span class="strong">Volume Discount</span> tab. The Volume Discount page appears.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="strong">New</span>. The Volume Discount Details page appears.<br></br><img src="../Resources/Images/advanced_volume.jpg" class="PWimg" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print"></img></li>
            <li>In the <span class="strong">Volume Discount</span> field, enter the name for this volume discount set. (There is a 50-character limit.) The name is for internal identification purposes only, and will not be visible to your customers.</li>
            <li>SKUs that use this set will display a hyperlink that customers can click to view volume discount information. You can enter your own text in the <span class="strong">Hyperlink Text</span> field, or accept the default.</li>
            <li>The <span class="strong">Description </span>field defines the text that will appear above the volume discount details. You can enter your own text here, or accept the default.</li>
            <li>Discounts in this set can be based on either dollars or percentages. Make your selection from the <span class="strong">Discount </span>list.</li>
            <li>
                <p>The first row of the set defines the volume discount for the range of 1 to whatever quantity you specify. The discount for the 1 to &lt;x&gt; range is typically 0 (to provide incentive for higher-volume purchases), but you can use any amount that you want. Enter the ending value for this range in the <span class="strong">Range</span> field, and enter the discount in the <span class="strong">Discount</span> field.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span>  As an example, if you wanted a quantity of 5 to be the first level that qualifies for a volume discount, you would set up the first row by entering 4 in the <span class="strong">Range</span> field, and 0 in the <span class="strong">Discount </span>field.</p>
            </li>
            <li>The ending row in a set always shows a range of &lt;x&gt; or more, with &lt;x&gt; being one more than the previous row's ending value. If no more rows are needed, you can fill out the ending row by entering a discount in the <span class="strong">Discount </span>field. Otherwise, if you need another row, you can create it by clicking the <span class="strong">Add </span>button. Repeat this process in successive rows to create as many rows as needed.</li>
            <li>When you're finished editing this set, click <span class="strong">Save</span>.</li>
        </ol>
