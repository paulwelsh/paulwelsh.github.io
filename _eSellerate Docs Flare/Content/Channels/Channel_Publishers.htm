        <h2>Channel Publishers</h2>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> Channels program enables sales partnerships between channel 
			web sites and software publishers. If <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> invites you to join the program 
			as a channel, you will work out an agreement with <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> offline, and then 
			use the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> Sales Manager to manage your channel offerings.</p>
        <h5>To add an <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> publisher to your channel:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Contact a publisher whose products you would like to sell.</li>
            <li>Work out an agreement that allows your channel web site to sell the publisher's 
					products. </li>
            <li>Submit the agreement to your <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> contact, who will make it available 
						in the Sales Manager for the publisher to review and accept. When the publisher 
						accepts the agreement, the publisher's information will appear in your Channel 
					Publishers list.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Next, the publisher can <a href="Channel_Pending.htm">submit SKUs</a> 
				for your channel to sell.</p>
