        <h2>Channel Returns</h2>
        <p>In sales partnerships established through the <a href="Channel_List.htm"><MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> Channels</a> program, the channel is responsible for product returns. Customers 
				that purchase your products through a channel are instructed to contact that 
				channel if they need to request refunds. However, because customers may still 
				contact you to request refunds on channel orders, the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> Sales Manager 
				provides functionality for directing those requests to the channel. </p>
        <p>Orders that were placed through a channel will appear under "Channel Orders 
						Found" in the <a href="../Order_Management/Orders_Returning.htm">Returns</a> search 
						results. If you look up an order to return and find that it is a channel order, 
					you can facilitate the return process by doing the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Tell the customer that you will forward the return request to the channel.</li>
            <li>Within the Returns search results, click the order's <span class="strong">Order Number</span> field. 
						The Channel Returns page displays.</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions provided to e-mail the channel a return request.</li>
        </ol>
