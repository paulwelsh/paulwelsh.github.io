        <h2>Language Selection</h2>
        <p>The Language Selection page is for specifying the languages that you want to use for localizing your stores. If you're not using localization, you can skip this help topic.</p>
        <p>It is possible to arrive at the Language Selection page from the publisher level (beginning at the Lexicon page) or from the eSeller level (Web Store or Embedded). When arriving from the eSeller level, there are additional options for controlling when each selected language is available in that eSeller. Preview status makes the language available for testing, and Active status makes the language available for customers to choose when they visit the live store.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong" style="color: #ff0000;">Warning:</span> In regard to non-English languages: Do not turn on Active languages for stores that are not using localized layouts.  The only time that you should set a non-English language to Active status is when the store is using a localized layout, and you have finished testing the language in your store.</p>
        <p>An example of the Language Selection page for an eSeller follows. In this case, the languages available for translating are English, French, and Chinese Simplified. For this particular eSeller, the preview (test) store will be able to show English or French, and the live store will be able to show English only.</p>
