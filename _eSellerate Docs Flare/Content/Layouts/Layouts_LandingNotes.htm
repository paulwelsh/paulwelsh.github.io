        <h2>Notes on Landing Pages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Landing Pages are defined as normal HTML pages, so you can use any HTML editor to design your pages.</li>
            <li><MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> provides two default pages that you will use as a starting point for your own Landing Pages.</li>
            <li>Looking at the default pages is the best way to understand Landing Pages functionality.</li>
            <li>The default pages will read in the following elements without requiring any customization on your part: the image, Short Description and "More Info" text designated for the SKU on the Basic tab of the SKU Detail page, and the URLs for the "Buy" and "Try" links. You will need to customize other elements on the pages.</li>
            <li>Default Landing Pages include one HTML file named default.htm. This file is required. You can add other HTML files if desired.</li>
            <li>The default pages will show "Try" links only if you offer an eST version of the corresponding SKU. Those links are Hosted eST links, which allow affiliates to provide trial versions of your software without having to host the downloads themselves.</li>
            <li>When a customer visits a Landing Page, <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> writes a cookie that includes the affiliate ID and any parameters passed in the query string. If the customer later purchases the product featured on that Landing Page, cookie information (if present) will be used to credit the affiliate for the sale.</li>
            <li>You should replace the default banner graphic (header.jpg) with one of your own. The Landing Page will use your banner if the affiliate has not uploaded one. Otherwise, if the affiliate has uploaded a banner, that banner will display in place of yours.</li>
            <li>For information on how to dynamically customize various elements when the Landing Page file is rendered, see <MadCap:xref href="Layouts_LandingTagsVars.htm#Layouts_2469577869_261731" target="" title="" alt="">Tags &amp; Variables</MadCap:xref>. Additional information on using variables is available at <MadCap:xref href="Layouts_LandingVarNotes.htm#Layouts_2469577869_262033" target="" title="" alt="">Variables Notes</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>Landing Pages support the use of cascading style sheets, which are grouped under CSS Files on the Files tab. You can use style sheets to control the formatting attributes of multiple HTML Landing Page files. Style sheets offer the advantage of keeping reusable code in one central location, so you can change the formatting of all files that use the style sheet by editing just one file.</li>
            <li>Due to the inherent simplicity of Landing Pages, the default pages do not use style sheets.</li>
            <li>For advanced customization of Landing Pages, you will need to use JavaScript. See the default HTML pages for examples of JavaScript usage.</li>
            <li>The supported image file extensions are .jpeg, .jpe, .jpg, .gif, .png and .bmp.</li>
            <li>Referencing external images is allowed.</li>
            <li>Non-HTML files that you upload to a Landing Page are automatically placed in a virtual "images" folder. Be sure to include "images/" in the path when you refer to the files in your HTML code. (Enclosing the path in double quotation marks is required.) For instance, after uploading an image file named "mylogo.gif" and a CSS file named "mystyles.css" you could refer to the files as follows: <ul><li>&lt;img src="images/mylogo.gif"&gt; </li><li>&lt;LINK REL="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="images/mystyles.css"&gt; </li></ul></li>
            <li>An example of how to link from one Landing Page to another follows: <ul><li>&lt;a href="http://get.esellerate.net/get/ALP123412345/MoreInfo.htm?affID=<br />&lt;external AffID&gt;&amp;SkuID=&lt;external SkuID&gt;&amp;AT=&lt;external AT&gt;"&gt;More Info&lt;/a&gt; </li></ul></li>
            <li>To find out which buttons on a Landing Page are used the most, you can include the publisher tracking code "PT" in each button's query string, and then track the results in <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> reports. For example, the following code would pass the tracking ID "buy1" when the customer clicks that particular "Buy" button: <ul><li>&lt;a href="http://store.eSellerate.net/a.asp?c=0_&lt;external skuID&gt;_&lt;external AffID&gt;&amp;PT=buy1"&gt;&lt;img src="images/buy.gif" border=0&gt;&lt;/a&gt; </li></ul></li>
            <li>When you delete a Landing Page, it still remains available to affiliates. For that reason, we recommend that you update Landing Pages rather than delete them. </li>
            <li>The total disk space allowed for all Landing Pages is 5 MB. Deleted files are not included in the disk space calculation. See the Landing Pages page for figures on disk space used and remaining. </li>
            <li>There is no limit to the number of Landing Pages that can concurrently exist in the Sales Manager (though total disk space restrictions apply). </li>
            <li>Each Landing Page can support an unlimited number of pages.</li>
        </ul>
