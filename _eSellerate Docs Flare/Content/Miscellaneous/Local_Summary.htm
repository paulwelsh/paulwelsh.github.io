        <h1>Summary of Setting Up Localization</h1>
        <p>The main steps for setting up localization are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the languages that you want to use for localizing your stores.</li>
            <li>Select the languages that you want each store to support.</li>
            <li>Assign the proper layouts to your stores. Two Standard Layouts are ready to use with localization right away. To prepare a Custom Layout for localization, you will need to start with one of the six default layouts that support this functionality.</li>
            <li>Use the Translations feature to localize customer-facing language that is specific to your own products and web stores.</li>
            <li>Make sure all the strings you wanted to localize have been filled out. This may involve any of the following:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Export your translations to Excel, and then look for empty fields in the Excel file.</li>
                <li>
                    If you added strings to the lexicon, export the lexicon to Excel, and then look through the Excel file to verify that you have filled out your new strings.
                </li>
                <li>Set the languages in your stores to Preview status only. Then, for each language, verify that your translations are complete and showing up in the places you expected.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>When you're ready to make the languages available in your stores, set the languages to Active status.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>As a reminder, for a language to show up in a store, the following must happen:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The language must be turned on for the publisher.</li>
            <li>The language must be turned on for the store.</li>
            <li>The language must have passed inspection for the Custom Layout in use (does not apply when using Standard Layouts).</li>
        </ul>
