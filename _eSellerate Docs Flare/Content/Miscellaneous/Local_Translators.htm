        <h1>Information for Translators</h1>
        <p>Whether they're working with layout strings (an exported Lexicon file) or publisher strings (an exported Translations file), translators should note the following precautions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Translators will need Excel 2007 or newer to work with the exported files.</li>
            <li>Do not make changes to code or HTML markup. For example, do not change HTML special characters such as "&amp;amp;" or "&amp;nbsp;" and do not change anything that is enclosed by { } or &lt; &gt;.</li>
            <li>Do not make changes to file names or paths. For example, do not change anything in this path: images/download.gif</li>
            <li>Do not change the names of spreadsheet columns. Also, reordering the columns can be problematic, so we recommend leaving them in their default places.</li>
            <li>In the Lexicon file, the only data changes that will be picked up on import are those made to the language columns (English, French, and so on).</li>
            <li>In the Translations file, the only data changes that will be picked up on import are those made to the non-English language columns (Spanish, French, and so on).</li>
            <li>It is possible to edit the English version of strings when working with the Lexicon file, but not the Translations file (because those edits will be ignored at import). With translations, any desired changes for English must be made in the Sales Manager.</li>
        </ul>
