            <MadCap:keyword term="international wire" />International Wire Payments</h1>
        <p>Information on  the international wire payment option for <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> orders follows.</p>
        <h4>Standards</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>This option is turned on by default for all publishers.</li>
            <li>Accepting international wire payments is an option for Web Store eSellers (with Custom Layouts or Standard Layouts) only. </li>
            <li>International wire can be used as the payment method for subscription orders, but only under special circumstances. These special circumstances are when the following conditions are true for all subscriptions in the shopping cart:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The renewal policy is manual renewal.</li>
                <li>The duration and billing frequency are such that no recurring billings occur during the duration of the subscription. For example, if the duration is 12 months, the billing frequency must be every 12 months so there are no charges other than at the beginning of the subscription period, and optionally at the end of the period, if the customer manually renews.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                <p>This payment option is available only when the customer's selected country and currency match one of the following pairs:</p>
                <p>Austria – EUR Euros</p>
                <p>Belgium – EUR Euros</p>
                <p>Switzerland – CHF Swiss Francs</p>
                <p>Germany – EUR Euros</p>
                <p>Denmark – DKK Danish Kroner</p>
                <p>Finland – EUR Euros</p>
                <p>France – EUR Euros</p>
                <p>Great Britain – GBP British Pounds</p>

                <p>Sweden SEK – Swedish Kronor</p>
            </li>
            <li>A $20 USD, non-refundable wire transfer fee is applied to all wire orders. This fee is clearly stated when customers choose wire transfer as the payment method.</li>
            <li>Custom Layouts created prior to when <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> introduced international wire payments (August 31, 2010) will need updated. See <MadCap:xref href="../Layouts/Layouts_CustomPaymentMethods.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Payment Methods Integration</MadCap:xref>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Customer Experience</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Customers choose wire transfer as the payment method. A message states that there will be a non-refundable wire transfer fee. The fee amount listed will be converted from $20 USD to the currently selected currency.</li>
            <li>On the receipt page, customers will see information on where to send their wire transfers.</li>
            <li>When customers finish placing their orders, they will receive an order processing e-mail that explains a pending order has been set up, and repeats the details on where to send the wire transfers. This e-mail will show 	the order number, order date, publisher name, order item details and amount due.</li>
            <li>The orders are in a pending state until payment is received.</li>
            <li>Once the wire payment is received, the customers will receive all normal correspondence that their order is complete. Downloads will become available, serial numbers will be issued, eCD orders will be sent, and so on. The publisher can complete fulfillment (ship items if needed) at this time.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Publisher Details</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Publishers do not receive their payments on these orders until <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> receives and processes the customers' payments.</li>
        </ul>
