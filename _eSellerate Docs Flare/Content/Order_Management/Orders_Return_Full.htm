        <h2>Full Order Returns</h2>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note</span>: For orders placed prior to August 31, 2010, coupon and shipping amounts will not be specified at the line level in Full Order Returns and Partial Returns/Refunds. Instead, these items will be applied across the entire order, and will appear in the top section of the returns pages. The look and functionality will be the same as returns done prior to when <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> expanded the options for returns (in August 2010).</p>
        <p>Full Order Returns will return all line items, cancel all subscriptions and serial numbers and refund the full amount of the order. (They also work with $0 orders.)</p>
        <p>This type of return will be unavailable if any return has already been done on the order.</p>
        <p>For a Full Order Return, you will need to complete the Verify Return Information page as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="strong">Return Date</span> – The return date will use the current date by default. You can change the date if desired.</li>
            <li><span class="strong">RMA&#160;Number</span> – If the return will use an RMA number, you can enter that number here (optional).</li>
            <li><span class="strong">Reason for Return</span> – Click this list to select a return reason. If you need to edit or create a return reason before you make your selection, click the <span class="strong">Edit Return Reasons</span> icon. When you're finished, you will need to navigate back to the Verify Return Information page.</li>
            <li><span class="strong">Comment</span> – Enter a comment (optional).</li>
            <li><span class="strong">Return E-mail Sender Address</span> – This field allows you to specify the "From" address for the notification e-mail that <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> will send to the customer when you finish processing this return. You can accept the default address, or enter a different one.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you're ready to proceed (there is no separate verification step with these returns), click <span class="strong">Process The Return</span>. </p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note</span>: If the payment type for the order was international wire, you will have additional steps to complete at this time. See <MadCap:xref href="Orders_Returning.htm#ReturningWire" target="" title="" alt="">Returning International Wire Orders</MadCap:xref>.&#160;</p>
        <p>The Return Detail page will display a summary of the return. Be sure to note the Status field, which will indicate one of the following statuses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Processed</li>
            <li>Submitted</li>
            <li>Pending</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more information on these statuses, see <MadCap:xref href="Orders_Returning.htm#ProcessedVersus" target="" title="" alt="">Processed versus Submitted versus Pending Returns</MadCap:xref>.</p>
