        <p>eSellerate SplitPay is a program that enables publishers to split the sales proceeds from select SKUs with third parties.</p>
        <p>For information on the benefits of this program, go to the Other Sales Partnerships section on the home page of the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> Sales Manager and click <span class="strong">About SplitPay</span>. (This link will change after you join the program.) The page that appears will outline the steps required to get started in the program.</p>
        <h5>After joining the program, you can set up split payments as follows:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Instruct your partners to do the following:<ol><li>Visit <a href="http://publishers.esellerate.net/splitpay" target="_blank">http://publishers.esellerate.net/splitpay</a> to set up their  eSellerate SplitPay payee accounts.</li><li>Provide you with their SplitPay IDs (available at the My Account page of the SplitPay Manager).</li></ol></li>
            <li>Click the <span class="strong">SplitPay </span>tab. The SplitPay Payee List page appears.<br /><img src="../Resources/Images/other_splitpay.jpg" class="PWimg" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" /></li>
            <li>Click <span class="strong">Add Payee</span>. The Add SplitPay Payee page appears.</li>
            <li><a name="payeedetail"></a>Enter the payee's SplitPay ID in the field provided and then click <span class="strong">Add Payee</span>. If you entered a valid SplitPay ID, the payee will receive e-mail notification that you have added it as a payee, and the Payee Detail page will appear.<br /><img src="../Resources/Images/other_splitpay_detail.jpg" class="PWimg" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" /></li>
            <li><a name="payeedetail2"></a>If this payee should have access to customer data, select the <span class="strong">Allow Payee Access to Customer Data</span> check box and then click <span class="strong">Save Changes</span>. (Unlike some payee properties, the payee does not receive e-mail notification of this property.) With this option checked, the payee will have access to the following customer data through SplitPay Manager sales reports:<ul><li>Customer name, e-mail address and contact preference</li><li>Serial numbers issued</li><li>Value entered by the customer when a SKU purchase involves a prompt for additional information (which is an option for some serial number sets)</li><li>A button for printing packing slips</li></ul></li>
            <li>If you clicked <span class="strong">Save Changes</span> for step 5, you will need to click <span class="strong">Edit Payee</span> to return to the Payee Detail page. Otherwise, skip to step 7.</li>
            <li>Click the link provided to go to the SKU List page.</li>
            <li>Select a SKU for editing.</li>
            <li>Set up the SKU's payee properties on the Advanced tab of the SKU Detail page, as described in <MadCap:xref href="../SKU_Management/SKU_SplitPay.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Adding the SKU's Payees (Optional)</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 2-9 for as many payees as required.</li>
        </ol>
