        <h2>Hosted eST Tracking</h2>
        <p>You can use this report to gauge the effectiveness of your marketing campaigns based on factors such as the number of Hosted eST downloads and Landing Page visits.</p>
        <h5>Notes</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>This report does not provide statistics for standard eST downloads.</li>
            <li>The date range for this report is based on the dates of Landing Page visits and downloads. Because sales can occur on different dates than the initial visits, it is difficult to accurately match visits to sales.</li>
            <li>The Visits figure refers to visits to Landing Pages. <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> records one visit per session.</li>
            <li>The Downloads figure refers to successful downloads of Hosted eST files. These downloads can be from a Landing Page, or a direct link to the Hosted eST files. Also note:<ul><li>If a line item includes one or more downloads and a Landing Page, then the downloads were from the specified Landing Page.</li><li>If a line item includes one or more downloads but no Landing Page, then the downloads were from a direct link to the Hosted eST file.</li></ul></li>
            <li>The Visits to DL figure refers to the percentage of Landing Page visits that resulted in downloads.</li>
            <li>The DL to Sales figure refers to the percentage of downloads that resulted in sales.</li>
            <li>The Visits to Sales figure refers to the percentage of Landing Page visits that resulted in sales.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>To run a Hosted eST Tracking report:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the <span class="strong">Admin Reports</span> tab. The Admin Reports page appears.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="strong">Hosted eST Tracking</span>. The Hosted eST Tracking page appears.<br /><img src="../Resources/Images/report_hosted_est.jpg" class="PWimg" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" /></li>
            <li>If you would like to narrow the scope of your report to specific items such as one SKU or one tracking ID, make your selections from the lists provided.</li>
            <li>The lists to the right of <span class="strong">Group By</span> are for controlling what displays in the first two columns of this report. Use the first list to set the first column, and the second list to set the second column.</li>
            <li>If you would like your report to find statistics within a specific date range, do one of the following to complete the <span class="strong">From </span>and <span class="strong">To </span>date fields:<ul><li>Click the calendar graphic to the right of <span class="strong">Date Range</span>, and then select from a list of common date ranges.</li><li>Edit or enter dates in the fields.</li><li>Right-click in each field, and then select from a list of common dates.</li><li>Click the calendar graphic to the right of each field, and then select a date from a calendar interface. (See <MadCap:xref href="Reports_CalendarInterface.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Selecting a Date from the Calendar Interface</MadCap:xref>.)</li></ul></li>
            <li>This report can return results as an HTML table, a tab-delimited file, a comma-delimited file or an XML file. Make your selection from the <span class="strong">Return Results As</span> list.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="strong">Run</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>If you selected HTML table results:</h5>
        <p>The table will display all statistics that matched your report criteria. If you grouped the results by any criterion other than none, some of the fields will display links that you can use to find more information.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> When Landing Page is displaying for either of the first two columns, links will display only for Landing Pages that still exist in your account. If you have deleted the Landing Page, or if it is the EZ Landing Page, the name will display as static text.</p>
        <p>Click any of the underlined column headings to sort your results by that criterion. You can then click the heading a second time to switch the sorting between ascending order and descending order.</p>
        <h5>If you selected comma-delimited, tab-delimited or XML file results:</h5>
        <p>The resulting Save As dialog will display a default file name, which you can change if desired. (The default file extension should be correct for your chosen format.) When you're finished making any changes to the file name, save the file.</p>
        <p>You can now import the file into a database, or open it in a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel.</p>
