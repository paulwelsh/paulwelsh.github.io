        <h2>SKU Sales by Country</h2>
        <p>You can use this report to see your SKU sales broken down by the country from which they originated. The results also include the currencies that your customers used to purchase your SKUs on a given transaction date, and the percentage that each currency contributed to the total purchase quantity.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> The primary differences between this report and a related report, SKU Sales by Currency, are that this report includes country information, and sorts results by country name.</p>
        <h5>To run a SKU Sales by Country report:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the <span class="strong">Sales Reports</span> tab.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="strong">SKU Sales by Country</span>. The SKU Sales by Country page appears.<br /><img src="../Resources/Images/report_sku_country.jpg" class="PWimg" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" /></li>
            <li> If you would like to limit your report results to a single SKU, make your selection from the <span class="strong">SKU </span>list. Otherwise, you can accept the default setting, which is <span class="strong">All SKUs</span>.</li>
            <li>If you would like your report to find SKU sales within a specific date range, do one of the following to complete the <span class="strong">From </span>and <span class="strong">To </span>date fields:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Click the calendar graphic to the right of <span class="strong">Date Range</span>, and then select from a list of common date ranges.</li>
                <li>Edit or enter dates in the fields.</li>
                <li>Right-click in each field, and then select from a list of common dates.</li>
                <li>Click the calendar graphic to the right of each field, and then select a date from a calendar interface. (See <MadCap:xref href="Reports_CalendarInterface.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Selecting a Date from the Calendar Interface</MadCap:xref>.)</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>This report can return results as an HTML table, a tab-delimited file, a comma-delimited file or an XML file. Make your selection from the <span class="strong">Return Results As</span> <![CDATA[ ]]>list.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="strong">Run</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>If you selected HTML table results:</h5>
        <p>The table will display all SKU sales that matched your report criteria.</p>
        <h5>If you selected comma-delimited, tab-delimited or XML file results:</h5>
        <p>The resulting Save As dialog will display a default file name, which you can change if desired. (The default file extension should be correct for your chosen format.) When you're finished making any changes to the file name, save the file.</p>
        <p>You can now import the file into a database, or open it in a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel.</p>
