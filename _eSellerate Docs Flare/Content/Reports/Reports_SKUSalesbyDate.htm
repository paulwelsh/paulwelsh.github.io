        <p>The table will display all SKU sales that matched your report criteria.</p>
        <p>Click any of the underlined column headings to sort your results by that criterion. An up arrow to the right of a column heading indicates that the report is sorted in ascending order (from the lowest to the highest value) by that criterion. A down arrow indicates descending order.</p>
        <p>For more information about a SKU, click its <span class="strong">Description </span>field. This will display all orders for that SKU that matched your report criteria.</p>
        <p>For more information about an individual SKU order, click its <span class="strong">Order ID</span> field.</p>
        <h5>If you selected comma-delimited, tab-delimited or XML file results:</h5>
        <p>The resulting Save As dialog will display a default file name, which you can change if desired. (The default file extension should be correct for your chosen format.) When you're finished making any changes to the file name, save the file.</p>
        <p>You can now import the file into a database, or open it in a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel.</p>
