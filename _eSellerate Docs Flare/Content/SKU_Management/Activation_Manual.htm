            <MadCap:keyword term="Product Activation:manually activating serial numbers" />Manually Activating Serial Numbers</h2>
        <p>To enable activation when the computer's configuration prevents the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> Engine from accessing the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> servers, you can use an API call to ManualActivateSerialNumber. This will bring up a wizard and allow the user to manually activate the software using a web browser on the current computer or another computer with web access.</p>
        <p>The standard ActivateSerialNumber function also provides the option to invoke the Manual Product Activation Wizard in the event that access to the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> servers is unavailable.</p>
        <p>For details on these API functions, see the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> SDK Reference.</p>
        <h4>Activation options screen<br /><img src="../Resources/Images/ManualActivate01.JPG" class="PWimg" /></h4>
        <p>Activation options is the first Manual Product Activation Wizard screen to appear. It explains to the user that automatic activation is not an option with the present computer configuration, and provides the following options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Activate using a web browser on this computer</li>
            <li>Activate using a different computer that has web access</li>
            <li>I already have an Activation Key and would like to activate now</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If configured to do so, the wizard will also present a fourth option:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I do not have any of the above options available to me</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> You can add a custom preface to the title displayed for all the wizard screens. For example, if you used "My Software," each screen title would be "My Software: Product Activation." See the ManualActivateSerialNumber descriptions for your development environment in the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> SDK Reference.</p>
