        <h2>Notes on Bundles and Enhancements for Serial Numbers</h2>
        <p>On May 5, 2009, <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> released SKU bundles, along with enhancements for serial numbers that included deferred serial numbers and the "Issue serial numbers in ratio to quantity" SKU option. The changes to allow these new options included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="strong">New eSellerate variables</span> – Forty-two eSellerate variables were added. For the current listing of all eSellerate variables, see the variables help pages at <a href="http://publishers.esellerate.net/customvar.aspx" target="_blank">http://publishers.esellerate.net/customvar.aspx</a> and <a href="http://publishers.esellerate.net/embeddedvar.aspx" target="_blank">http://publishers.esellerate.net/embeddedvar.aspx</a>. (To view help on these pages, hover your mouse over the variable name, or click the bullet to the left of the variable.)</li>
            <li><span class="strong">Custom Layout updates</span> – There were changes to three or four HTML pages in each default layout.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Custom Layouts that you create after May 5, 2009, (using a default layout as your starting point) will use the new variables and include the layout changes by default. Layouts that you created prior to that date will require some updates, as described here.</p>
        <h3>Preparing Custom Layouts for the New Functionality</h3>
        <p>The HTML files that changed for each default layout were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="strong">Embedded Multi-Page Layout</span>: Receipt.htm, EmbeddedMultiConfirmation.htm, EmbeddedMultiSerialNumberPrompts.htm</li>
            <li><span class="strong">Embedded Simple Layout</span>: Receipt.htm, EmbeddedSimpleCart_CardsOnly.htm, EmbeddedSimpleConfirmation.htm, EmbeddedSimpleCart.htm</li>
            <li><span class="strong">Multi-Page Layout</span>: Receipt.htm, MultiSerialNumberPrompts.htm, MultiConfirmation.htm</li>
            <li>Simple Layout: Receipt.htm, OnePageCart.htm, OnePageConfirmation.htm, OnePageCart_CardsOnly.htm</li>
            <li><span class="strong">Stylized Embedded Web Store - Option 1</span>: Receipt.htm, EmbeddedMultiConfirmation.htm, EmbeddedMultiSerialNumberPrompts.htm</li>
            <li><span class="strong">Stylized Embedded Web Store - Option 2</span>: Receipt.htm, EmbeddedMultiConfirmation.htm, EmbeddedMultiShippingMethod.htm, EmbeddedMultiSerialNumberPrompts.htm</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>To update layouts for these changes, you can do either of the following:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a temporary layout that is the same type as the one you want to update, and then use HTML files from that layout to replace the outdated ones. This would involve downloading layout files from the temporary layout, and uploading the files to the layout that requires the updates. For information on downloading and uploading layout files, see <MadCap:xref href="../Layouts/Layouts_CustomFiles.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Files Tab</MadCap:xref>. Also note: <ul><li>Compared to the other approach listed here, this one is typically faster, and it involves less risk for errors.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Paste the required code into each of the outdated HTML files. A document that explains this process is available for downloading through this link: <a href="http://support.esellerate.net/FileManagement/Download/f4420aac2f1f474e9b5636db6e21065a" target="_blank">http://support.esellerate.net/FileManagement/Download/f4420aac2f1f474e9b5636db6e21065a</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> A system page provides the receipts for layouts that do not have a Receipt Page assigned. That system page is functionally the same as Receipt.htm in the default layouts, so it will work with bundles and the serial number enhancements previously mentioned.</p>
