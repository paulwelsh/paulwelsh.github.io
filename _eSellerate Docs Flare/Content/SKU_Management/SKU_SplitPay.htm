            <MadCap:keyword term="eSellerate SplitPay:setting up SKU relationships" />Adding the SKU's Payees (Optional)</h2>
        <p>The SKU SplitPay section of the Advanced tab is for setting up SKU relationships with payees in the  eSellerate SplitPay program. (See <MadCap:xref href="../Other_Sales_Partnerships/Other_SplitPay.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Joining  eSellerate SplitPay</MadCap:xref>.) It allows you to specify the following payee properties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Which payee(s) should receive a portion of the sales proceeds from the selected SKU</li>
            <li>Whether the SKU split payment is based on a dollar amount or a percentage of the SKU price</li>
            <li>The rate each payee receives</li>
            <li>If date restrictions are required, a begin date and/or an end date</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> Before setting up SKU relationships with payees, you must first add at least one payee to your payee list.</p>

            <MadCap:keyword term="SKUs:setting up split payments for" />To set up split payments for this SKU:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Use the provided list to select a payee. If you need to edit or create a payee record before you make your selection, click <span class="strong">Save</span>, and then click the <span class="strong">Edit Payees</span> icon.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="strong">Add</span>. The payee will receive e-mail confirmation that you have created the SKU relationship, and the payee will be added to the Payee Name listings for this SKU.</li>
            <li>By default, the SKU split payment is based on a dollar amount. If you would like to base the payment on a percentage of the SKU price, select <span class="strong">SKU SplitPay is %-Based</span>.</li>
            <li>Enter a rate in the <span class="strong">Rate </span>field, making sure to consider any additional payees that you might add for this SKU.</li>
            <li>If desired, enter a date in the <span class="strong">Start Date</span> field. The start date represents the date when the split payments can begin. If you do not specify a start date, the split payments can begin immediately.</li>
            <li>If desired, enter a date in the <span class="strong">End Date</span> field. The end date represents the date when the split payments will end. If you do not specify an end date, the split payments can continue until you choose to stop them (by removing payees from the SKU relationship).</li>
            <li>Click <span class="strong">Save</span>. The payee will receive e-mail notification of the settings you chose for rate and calculation basis (dollar or percentage), and of any start and end dates that apply.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 1-7 to add as many payees as desired.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>After setting up split payments for this SKU, you may make changes at any time. As with initial setup, your payees will receive e-mail notification of the changes.</p>
