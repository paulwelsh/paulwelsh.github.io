            <MadCap:keyword term="serial numbers:manually generating" />Manually Generating Serial Numbers</h2>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> system offers three primary ways to issue serial numbers for the software you sell:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Serial numbers can be automatically issued at the time that your products are purchased through <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" />.</li>
            <li>Serial numbers can be deferred at the time of purchase and issued later through  <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> After-Purchase Services (<a href="http://store.esellerate.net/support" target="_blank">http://store.esellerate.net/support</a>). The option to defer serial numbers ("Issue serial numbers after purchase") is set at the SKU level. See <MadCap:xref href="SKU_Advanced.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Setting the SKU's Advanced Properties (Optional)</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>For products purchased through non-<MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> sales channels, you can manually generate the serial numbers and then provide them to your customers. Information on that process follows.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Notes</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Manual serial number generation is available for Standard and Standard Enhanced serial numbers only.<ul><li>This feature is not available for serial number sets that have a delivery method of License File or Serial Number &amp; License File.</li></ul></li>
            <li>You can manually generate serial numbers one at a time, or in bulk. </li>
            <li>There is a fee for using <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> Product Activation with a serial number that was issued for a non-eSellerate order. This fee applies to manually generated serial numbers, and to serial numbers imported to <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> for activation purposes. For fee information, see <MadCap:xref href="Activation_Ext_Import.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Importing External Serial Numbers for Activation</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>If you use Product Activation with manually generated serial numbers, you should not import those serial numbers through the interface on the Product Activation Sets page. The act of generating the serial numbers makes them known to the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> system, so there is no need for a separate import process.</li>
        </ul>
