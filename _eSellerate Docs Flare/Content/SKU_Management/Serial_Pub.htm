            <MadCap:keyword term="serial numbers:External:Publisher E-Mailed" />Publisher E-Mailed</h2>
        <p>With this option, receipts and order confirmations will tell the purchasers that their serial numbers will be e-mailed to them soon. You are responsible for sending the serial numbers to the purchasers.
<br /><img src="../Resources/Images/external_pub.jpg" class="PWimg" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" /></p>
        <p>The complete statement used in receipts and order confirmations is as follows: "CompanyName (E-mail Address) will e-mail your serial number to you soon." To fill in the company name and e-mail address, <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> uses the receipt information that is set up for your account. This will be your Default Receipt Information except in cases when you have overridden it with eSeller Receipt Information. (See <MadCap:xref href="../Account_Management/Account_Receipt.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Entering Default Receipt Information</MadCap:xref>.)
</p>
        <p>There are numerous <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> resources available for tracking orders that require you to send a serial number. Some examples are online sales reports and automated e-mail reports.
</p>
        <p>Information on how to use the available settings for Publisher E-mailed serial numbers follows.
</p>
        <h5>To create a Publisher E-mailed serial number set:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>From the <span class="strong">External Type</span> list, select <span class="strong">Publisher E-mailed</span>.</li>
            <li>
                <p>You can use prompts to gather customer input, which you will then be able to access through various <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> reports. If you enable this feature, your <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> web stores (regular and embedded) will prompt customers to enter specific information as part of the purchase process.</p>
                <p>From the <span class="strong">Prompt For</span> list, select the information your web stores should require for SKUs that use this serial number set. Your choices are as follows:
</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>None 
</li>
                    <li>RegCode 
</li>
                    <li>Palm OS® HotSync Name 
</li>
                    <li>Pocket PC Owner Name 
</li>
                    <li>(Custom Prompt) 
</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> When appropriate, online help will be available to show your customers how to locate handheld device information such as RegCode.
</p>
            </li>
            <li>The <span class="strong">Custom Prompt</span> field appears/applies only when you select the "(Custom Prompt)" option in the Prompt For list. Text that you enter here (up to 50 characters) will define the prompt displayed to your customers. For example, if you enter "Nickname" in the Custom Prompt field, your web store will display "<span class="strong">Nickname:</span> [input field]" when that information is required for a SKU purchase.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="strong">Save Changes</span>.</li>
        </ol>
