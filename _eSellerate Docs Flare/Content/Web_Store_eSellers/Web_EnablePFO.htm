            <MadCap:keyword term="Web Store eSellers:enabling phone and fax orders;phone and fax orders" />Enabling Phone and Fax Orders</h2>
        <p>For your customers that may prefer alternatives to purchasing online, <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> supports phone and fax orders. You can use this service to enable phone/fax ordering of the products offered in your <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> web store(s). Implementation is as simple as setting one option in the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> Sales Manager and displaying phone and fax order links for your products on your company web site.</p>
        <p>Terms of use for phone/fax orders are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hours of operation are Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Central Time (excluding American holidays). Fax orders may be sent anytime but will only be processed during normal business hours. Phone orders will only be accepted during normal business hours.</li>
            <li>There is a $20 monthly fee for using <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" />'s phone/fax order service. On the first day of each month, <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> will create a $20 negative adjustment to your account balance if you had the phone/fax checkbox enabled for your web store(s) at any time during the previous month.</li>
            <li>All sales will be by credit card and in one of the currencies accepted by <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" />.<ul><li>Because PayPal users have no way to authenticate their purchases when ordering by phone or fax, <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> does not accept that payment method for phone/fax orders.</li></ul></li>
            <li>The supported language for phone/fax orders is English only.</li>
            <li>Publishers using this service waive terms of sale for products sold by phone or fax.</li>
            <li>Shipping is not available for fax orders. Accordingly, the fax order form will exclude SKUs that require shipping. This restriction exists because a customer cannot properly determine shipping costs or shipping options provided by a publisher from a static form.</li>
            <li>Phone/fax order service is not available for private web stores.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>To implement phone/fax orders:</h5>

            <li>
                <p>A web page displays all active SKUs in your web store, along with pricing in U.S. dollars and short descriptions. (This excludes hidden SKUs, which only display as cross-sell items. Also, fax order pages exclude SKUs that require shipping.)</p>

            <li>The customer places an order in one of these ways: <ul><li>For a phone order, the customer calls and provides order information to an  <![CDATA[ ]]><MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> representative.</li><li>For a fax order, the customer types in most of the order information directly. The customer then prints out the fax form, completes it and faxes it to <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" />.</li></ul></li>
            <li>The <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> representative enters the order on a secure intranet system. Order processing then proceeds like any other <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> purchase. </li>
            <li>The customer receives order confirmation (including registration information) and shipping e-mail messages as required.</li>
            <li>When purchases involve a digital download, the order confirmation message will include a special URL that the customer will use to download the product.</li>
        </ol>
