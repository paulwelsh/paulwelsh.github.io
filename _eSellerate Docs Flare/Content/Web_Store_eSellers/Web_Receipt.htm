        <h2>Web Store: Receipt Information</h2>
        <p>The Receipt Information section of the Web Store eSeller Detail page includes the options described here.</p>
        <p>If you would like this eSeller to use different receipt information than the defaults set at the Receipt Information page, follow the instructions below. Otherwise, you can skip this step (and leave the Receipt Information section for this eSeller blank).</p>
        <p>To use the override option, select the <span class="strong">Override Default Publisher Receipt Information</span> check box and then enter your receipt information. Required fields are marked with an asterisk.</p>
        <p>Information you enter here will be used in the following places:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Receipts created at the conclusion of a purchase (see also <MadCap:xref href="../Layouts/Layouts_CustomReceiptPag.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Receipt Page Notes</MadCap:xref>)</li>
            <li>Order Confirmation, Order Fulfillment and Return Notification e-mail sent to the customer</li>
            <li><MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> Order Notice e-mail sent to the addresses specified for the per-transaction report (available through Account Information)</li>
            <li>Packing slips</li>
            <li>CD labels used in eCD fulfillment</li>
            <li>Order information accessed by customers through  <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> Credit Card Charges Information (<a><a href="http://www.eslr8.com/" target="_blank">http://www.eslr8.com</a></a>) and  <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> After-Purchase Services (<a><a href="http://store.esellerate.net/support" target="_blank">http://store.esellerate.net/support</a></a>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> With the exception of the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> Order Notice e-mail, per-eSeller receipt information affects customer communications only. All other e-mail that you receive from <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> will use the defaults set at the Receipt Information page when applicable.<br /></p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span>&#160;There are some settings on the Receipt Information page that you cannot affect by overriding default receipt information. These settings are the  introductory text and product support text for Order Confirmation and Order Fulfillment e-mail, as set in the Customized Order E-mail section.</p>
