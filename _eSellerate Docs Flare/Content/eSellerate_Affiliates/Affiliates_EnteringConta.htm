        <h2>Entering Affiliate Contact Information</h2>
        <p>Use the Contact Information page to define your contact information that will be available to all affiliates.<br /><img src="../Resources/Images/affiliates_contact.jpg" class="PWimg" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" /></p>
        <h5>To enter your affiliate contact information:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Complete the <span class="strong">Contact E-mail</span> field. This will be the "From" address for e-mails sent for event notifications, such as when you approve an affiliate's request to sell your products. This address can also be used by affiliates wanting more information about your available products.</li>
            <li>Complete the <span class="strong">Notification E-mail</span> field. This will be the "To" address where you will receive e-mails sent for event notifications, such as when an affiliate signs up to sell one of your products.</li>
            <li>If you complete the  <span class="strong">Website</span> field (which is optional), the URL will be available to affiliates who view your available products.</li>
            <li>If you would like to manually approve each new affiliate, select the <span class="strong">Approval</span> check box. With this option, once approved to sell your products, an affiliate can sell any product you make available.</li>
            <li>
                <p>The Contact Information page also offers an easy way to promote your products to potential affiliates. See the on-screen instructions for details.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Tip:</span> If you host the affiliate web site in frames within your own web site, you have the option to hide the affiliate banner. To do this, add "&amp;showbanner=false" to the end of any URLs that you use to reference the affiliate site. For example, the following URL would open a customized affiliate invitation page and hide the banner for the duration of the session: http://Affiliates.eSellerate.net/JoinNow.aspx?PubIDC=PUB123456789&amp;showbanner=false</p>
            </li>
            <li>Click <span class="strong">Save Changes</span>.</li>
        </ol>
