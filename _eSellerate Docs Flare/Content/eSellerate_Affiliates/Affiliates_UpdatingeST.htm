        <p>To update an eST download, you can do either of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>From the Available SKU Detail page, select a different download file and then click <span class="strong">Save Changes</span>.</li>
            <li>From the Download Detail page, upload a new file to replace one that serves as an eST download.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you update an eST download or assign one to an available SKU that previously didn't offer eST, <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CompanyName" /> will display a page that gives you the option to notify all affiliates affected by the change. This notification will be an e-mail message sent to all active affiliates that sell the SKU(s) associated with the eST download. The e-mail will list the updated eST download and the associated SKU(s), and provide a link that the affiliate can use to directly log in to the affiliate management system and obtain the new download. You can add an additional message to end of the e-mail if desired. If the changes you made would not require affiliates to replace existing versions of the eST download, you can skip sending the e-mail by clicking <span class="strong">Do Not Notify Affiliates</span>.</p>
