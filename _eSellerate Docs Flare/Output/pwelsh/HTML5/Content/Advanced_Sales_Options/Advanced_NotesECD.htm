        <h2>Notes on eCD</h2>
        <p>When learning about eCD, it's important to start with the definitions below. We'll be referring to these two eCD types throughout the documentation.</p>
        <h4>Definitions</h4>
        <p>There are two main types of eCD: </p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">eCD Included – eCD&#160;is included with the SKU purchase when <span class="strong">Delivery Method</span> on the SKU Advanced tab is set to <span class="strong">Download and eCD</span> or <span class="strong">eCD Only</span>.</li>
            <li value="2">eCD Optional – eCD&#160;is optional with the SKU purchase when <span class="strong">Delivery Method</span> on the SKU Advanced tab is set to <span class="strong">Download Only (eCD Optional)</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Choosing an eCD Type</h4>
        <p>When choosing an eCD type, you should consider whether you want to include a CD with the SKU purchase (eCD Included), or offer a CD as an option that customers can purchase at an additional cost (eCD Optional). </p>
        <p>Another consideration is your production costs, which may be higher with eCD Included because each SKU using this type requires its own CD. The costs can also be higher with eCD Included when you use certain subscription settings. (See <a href="#production" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">Production Costs</a>.) </p>
        <p>Finally, with eCD Included you can send CDs at various times during a subscription period (for recurring billings and renewals) in addition to sending them with the initial order. (See <a href="#subscriptionoptions" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">Subscription Options</a>.)</p>
        <h4>CD Contents</h4>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">eCD Included – The CD can contain content for one SKU (the one that included eCD), plus trial files when applicable.</li>
            <li value="2">eCD Optional – The CD can contain content for all SKUs in the order that are set up for eCD Optional. It can also contain trial files when applicable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more information, see <a href="Advanced_OrganizingECD.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">Organizing Your Files for eCD</a>.</p>
        <h4><a name="production"></a>Production Costs</h4>
        <p>You pay a set fee per CD (the  eSellerate eCD charge), plus your usual <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span> service fee percentage of the total purchase price. </p>
        <p>For details on your production costs, please see the eCD Configuration tab in your publisher account. That tab shows the  eSellerate eCD charge, and explains how the charge is applied differently between the two eCD types.</p>
        <h4><a name="pricing"></a>Pricing </h4>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>eCD Included – Because eCD is included with the SKU, you will need to add eCD into the SKU price. Be sure to cover all your production costs, including any additional charges for DVD cases and certain subscription settings. (See <a href="#production" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">Production Costs</a>.) You can also set your pricing to make a profit on eCD if desired.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> The two places where you can set SKU pricing are the SKU Basic tab and the SKU Pricing page.  </p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>eCD Optional – At a minimum, the customer pays the  eSellerate eCD charge. In order to cover all your production costs, including any additional charges for DVD cases (see <a href="#production" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">Production Costs</a>), you can set a markup on the total purchase price. The markup can be higher than your production costs if you choose to make a profit on eCD. You set the markup under "eCD Optional" on the eCD Configuration tab.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> Instead of setting the eCD price for each SKU as with eCD Included, with eCD Optional you set the price in one central location.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Cart Behavior</h4>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">eCD Included – A SKU with eCD&#160;Included looks and behaves the same as any regular SKU&#160;in the shopping cart. There is no built-in indicator that eCD is included, so it is the publisher's responsibility to convey that fact with text and images as needed.          <![CDATA[ ]]></li>
            <li value="2">eCD Optional – When the customer adds the first eCD-enabled SKU to the shopping cart, a hyperlinked "eCD available" graphic appears next to the SKU name, and eCD appears as a purchase option at the bottom of the page. The customer can click either the "eCD available" graphic or a "What is eCD" link to learn more about the option. (This is the default behavior for presenting eCD as a purchase option. For an alternative, see <a href="Advanced_ECDConfig.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">eCD Configuration</a>.)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a name="subscriptionoptions"></a>Subscription Options</h4>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">eCD Included – When you sell a SKU through a subscription model with eCD&#160;Included, you can determine the eCD delivery frequency. There will always be a CD delivered with the initial order (the basis for all the frequency options), but you can also choose to have it delivered at additional times in the subscription period, including renewals and recurring billings. You set eCD delivery frequency on the SKU Advanced tab.</li>
            <li value="2">eCD Optional – When you sell a SKU&#160;through a subscription model with eCD Optional, the customer can purchase eCD in conjunction with the SKU purchase. In that case, there will be a CD delivered with the initial order only. In contrast to eCD&#160;Included, with eCD&#160;Optional there are no options for delivering CDs at additional times in the subscription period.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Reporting</h4>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">eCD Included – Because eCD is included with the SKU, it is not a separate line item for most reporting purposes. One exception to note: When <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span> creates a payment voucher, there will be a negative adjustment line item for eCD Fulfillment Expense in the Transaction Ledger sales report and the Payments report.</li>
            <li value="2">eCD Optional – The <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span> eCD SKU is a separate line item for reporting purposes, and will appear in <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span> reports when appropriate.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">The  eSellerate eCD charge covers shipping to locations worldwide.</li>
            <li value="2">In the case of returned orders, the  eSellerate eCD charge is nonrefundable. (You can provide your customers with a full refund, but as the publisher you will have already incurred the cost of the eCD charge.) Therefore, we recommend adding language to your return policy such as: "The CD cost is nonrefundable. If you receive a CD that is damaged or defective, it will be replaced at no charge."</li>
            <li value="3">In contrast to our other fulfillment options, with eCD there is no need for you to: <ul><li value="1">Set up shipping tables.</li><li value="2">Set SKUs to require shipping.</li><li value="3">Ship orders.</li><li value="4">Mark orders as fulfilled.</li></ul></li>
            <li value="4">Customer support questions regarding the CD shipment will be directed to eCD@esellerate.net. </li>
            <li value="5">There are a number of customization options available to you with eCD. For details, see <a href="Advanced_ECDLay.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">eCD Layouts</a> and <a href="Advanced_ECDImg.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">eCD Images</a>.</li>
            <li value="6">The CD can contain an autorun HTML menu of its contents (Windows only).</li>
            <li value="7">eCD&#160;Optional only:<ul><li value="1"><span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span> creates one  eSellerate eCD SKU per publisher. You cannot access or edit this SKU.</li><li value="2">The  eSellerate eCD SKU will appear in order receipts and order confirmation e-mail. The per-SKU message for this SKU will include shipping details, and state that the CD delivery will be separate from any other deliveries involved in the order.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
