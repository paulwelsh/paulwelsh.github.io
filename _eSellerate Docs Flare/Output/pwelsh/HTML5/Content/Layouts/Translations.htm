        <h2>Translations</h2>
        <p>Translations have to do with the localization of Custom Layout variables. If you're working with localization, you can use the Translations page to localize customer-facing language that is specific to your products and web stores.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> If you haven't already specified the languages that you want to use for localizing your stores, you will need to go to the Select Languages page to complete that task. For more information, see <a href="../Miscellaneous/Local_Steps.htm#Selectin" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">Selecting Languages for Localization</a>.</p>
        <h3>Localizing Publisher Content (Translations)</h3>
        <p>Localizable items are designated by a "Translate Data" icon   in the Sales Manager.  A few examples of these localizable items: SKU Name, Short Description (SKU setting), Store Name (eSeller setting), and Support URL (Receipt Information). Clicking <span class="strong">Translate Data</span> brings up the Translations page for the corresponding item. At that point, there are two possible ways to edit the strings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Edit the strings one-by-one on the Translations page in the Sales Manager, and click <span class="strong">Save Changes</span> when you're finished. </li>
            <li value="2">Export all translations to Excel for editing, and later import the modified Excel file.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> 
               Non-English translations that are left blank will default to English. For example, if the web store is showing Spanish, but there is no Spanish translation for Store Name, then the English translation for that item will appear. (This assumes that an English translation exists.) To intentionally blank out a translation so that nothing shows up for it in the corresponding language, you can enter non-displaying content such as &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> We recommend that you frequently back up your translationsâ€”ideally every time that you finish making significant changes. By exporting the translations to Excel and archiving the Excel files somewhere, you will have a way to easily restore your most recent work if data is ever lost.</p>
        <h4>Exporting Translations to Excel for Backups and External Editing</h4>
        <p>The export will include the languages that you have enabled on the Select Languages page. (Exports always include English, regardless of whether that language is enabled.)</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> Because Excel cells have a 32,767-character limit, exports will not be permitted if any elements in your translations are larger than 32K. In that case, you'll need to work on your translations through the Sales Manager interface only, without doing any exporting or importing.</p>
        <p>To export the translations, click <span class="strong">Export All Translations to Excel</span>, and then save the file.</p>
        <h4>Importing Translations from Excel</h4>
        <p class="pwNote"><strong style="color: #ff0000;">Warning:</strong> Before you import from Excel, make sure that you have already backed up the translations in their current state by exporting to Excel. Backing up the translations is critical because it is possible for you to mistakenly wipe out data on imports.</p>
        <p>When you're ready to import edited translations, and you've heeded the preceding warning about backups, click <span class="strong">Import Translations from Excel</span>. Click <span class="strong">Browse </span>(or <span class="strong">Choose File</span> if you're using Chrome or Safari),  locate an Excel file for importing, and then click <span class="strong">Process File</span>.</p>
