        <h2><a name="kanchor171"></a>E-check (ACH) Payments</h2>
        <p>Information on  the e-check (ACH) payment option for <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span> orders follows.</p>
        <h4>Standards</h4>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">This option is turned on by default for all publishers.</li>
            <li value="2">Accepting ACH payments is an option for Web Store eSellers (with Custom Layouts or Standard Layouts) only.</li>
            <li value="3">ACH can be used as the payment method for subscription orders. Publishers offering ACH may want to consider adding a grace period to their subscriptions to account for the longer processing times (compared to credit cards or PayPal).</li>
            <li value="4">ACH is available only for USD transactions with a billing address in the United States.</li>
            <li value="5">Custom Layouts created prior to when <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span> introduced ACH payments (August 31, 2010) will need updated. See <a href="../Layouts/Layouts_CustomPaymentMethods.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">Payment Methods Integration</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Customer Experience</h4>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Customers who select ACH as the payment method will need to check a box signifying that they agree to the ACH terms and conditions. Along with their banking information, they will need to provide the last four digits of their driver's license number and select the driver's license state. A check image is available for showing customers where to find the required banking information.</li>
            <li value="2">ACH takes 5-7 business days to complete, and processing does not happen on weekends or holidays.</li>
            <li value="3">When customers finish placing their orders, they will receive an order processing e-mail that explains a pending order has been set up. This e-mail will show 	the order number, order date, publisher name, order item details and amount due.</li>
            <li value="4">The orders are in a pending state until payment is received.</li>
            <li value="5">Once the ACH&#160;request has cleared their bank, the customers will receive all normal correspondence that their order is complete. Downloads will become available, serial numbers will be issued, eCD orders will be sent, and so on. The publisher can complete fulfillment (ship items if needed) at this time.</li>
            <li value="6">If there is an issue with subscription recurring or renewal billings, the customers will receive an e-mail with instructions on how to update their payment information through <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span> After-Purchase Services (<a href="http://store.esellerate.net/support" target="_blank">http://store.esellerate.net/support</a>).</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Publisher Details</h4>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Publishers do not receive their payments on these orders until <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span> receives and processes the customers' payments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
