        <h2>Order Detail Page</h2>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> The information that is available on the Order Detail page does not include your profit or <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span>'s commission on your orders from 4/1/2011 and later. <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="Primary.Online">To find that information and more, please use <a href="../Reports/Reports_Business_Intel.htm">Business Intelligence reporting</a>.</MadCap:conditionalText> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <p>The Order Detail page is accessible through a number of links, which include the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">All of the Order Management functions (Orders, Fulfillment, Returns and Voids) will return Order Number links in their search results.</li>
            <li value="2">Whenever applicable, <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span> reports will return Order Number links in their results.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This page lists all significant details for an order in one convenient place. It also provides the following options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><span class="strong">Packing Slip</span> – This button appears for all orders except those that involve voids. Clicking it brings up a printable packing slip for the order. (See also <a href="Orders_Packing_Slips.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref">Printing Packing Slips</a>.)</li>
            <li value="2"><span class="strong">Void </span>– This button appears only when you have reached the Order Detail page from the Voids editor. See <a href="Orders_Voiding.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref">Voiding Orders</a> for more information.</li>
            <li value="3">
                <p><span class="strong">Change Address</span> – Use this button to change the billing address and/or the shipping address for the order (if the order involved shipping). The window that appears will display all address information that applies. Make any needed changes and additions to the information, and then click <span class="strong">Save Changes</span>.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> Serial numbers based on company name will always be based on the original company name entered for the order, regardless of any changes you make to company name within the billing address. (See also <a href="../SKU_Management/Creating_Serial.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref">Creating Serial Numbers</a>.)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><span class="strong">E-mail</span> – To send an e-mail message to the customer, click <span class="strong">E-mail</span>. A new e-mail message will appear for you to fill out and send.</li>
            <li value="2">
                <p><span class="strong">Change Customer E-mail</span> – To change the customer e-mail record for the order, enter the new e-mail in the <span class="strong">Change E-mail</span> field and then click <span class="strong">Change Customer E-mail</span>.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> If you change the customer e-mail record, the customer will need to use the new address when searching for the order at the <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span> After-Purchase Services web page (<a href="http://store.esellerate.net/support" target="_blank">http://store.esellerate.net/support</a>).</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3"><span class="strong">Coupon </span>– If the order involved a coupon, you can click a link to view the coupon's Detail page.</li>
            <li value="4">
                <p><span class="strong">Clear Reinstall Limit</span> – This button appears only if the customer has reinstalled a product purchased in the order. (Directions for reinstalling or re-downloading purchased software are available on the first screen of the <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span> Software Delivery Wizard, and on the <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span> After-Purchase Services web page at <a href="http://store.esellerate.net/support" target="_blank">http://store.esellerate.net/support</a>.)</p>
                <p>To prevent software piracy, <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span> limits customers to a set number of reinstallations per order. <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span> calculates an order's reinstall limit by multiplying the quantity purchased (minus any returns) by three. For example, if a customer purchases a quantity of four, the reinstall limit for that order is 4x3, or 12. Customers who reach the reinstall limit and want to request more reinstallations must contact the publisher for assistance. If you need to make adjustments for such an order, you can use the <span class="strong">Clear Reinstall Limit</span> button to reset the Reinstall Count to 0.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> Your web store customers have the option to extend their download capabilities by purchasing <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span> Download Protection service (eDP). eDP is in effect for the order when the eDP SKU appears under Order Items (with no return quantity) and the Entry Date is within one year of the present date. During the time that eDP is in effect, the Reinstall Count will remain at 0 and the Clear Reinstall Limit option will not apply. Once eDP expires or is returned, the order will be subject to the reinstall limit described here, and you will be able to reset the Reinstall Count to 0 as needed. For information on eDP, see <a href="../Account_Management/Account_eDP.htm" class="MCXref xref">Presenting the eSellerate Download Protection (eDP) Option to Customers</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5"><span class="strong">Shipping </span>– If the order involved shipping, you can click a link to view the shipping table's Detail page.</li>
            <li value="6">
                <p><span class="strong">Resend Order E-mails</span> – This option allows you to resend order e-mail messages that the customer may have missed. (If the customer entered an incorrect address when ordering, you will first need to change the address with the "Change Customer E-mail" option.)</p>
                <p>From the <span class="strong">Resend E-mails</span> list, select the desired e-mail and then click <span class="strong">Resend Order E-mails</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="7"><span class="strong">Order Notes</span> – You can use this text field to enter notes about the order. (There is a 1,000-character limit.) When you're finished, click <span class="strong">Save Order Notes</span>.</li>
            <li value="8"><span class="strong">Show Custom Data</span> – If the order involved collecting data and storing it in custom variables (which is an option for Custom Layouts only), clicking <span class="strong">Show Custom Data</span> will show the values for the variables. For more information on the custom data variables, see <a href="../Layouts/Layouts_CustomVariablesN.htm#Layouts_2469577869_78668" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref">Notes on Using eSellerate Variables</a>.</li>
            <li value="9"><span class="strong">Activations</span> – If the order involved serial numbers, the Order Detail page will include an Activations link for each serial number issued. See <a href="Orders_Activation_Detail.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref">Activation Details Page</a>.</li>
            <li value="10"><span class="strong">Subscription Events Testing – Preview Orders</span> – If you're viewing a preview order that involved subscriptions, the Order Detail page will provide options for testing subscription events.
