        <p>After an approved affiliate signs up to sell one of your SKUs, you can make changes that affect that affiliate only. For example, when you submit a SKU for listing in the affiliate system, you enter a default commission rate. All of your publishers will earn the default commission rate for selling that SKU, unless you change the rate for an individual affiliate.</p>
        <p>In addition to setting an affiliate's commission rate, other changes that you can make at the affiliate level include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Locking the affiliate's commission rate so that so that changes made at the Available SKU Detail page will not affect it </li>
            <li value="2">Deleting one of your SKUs so that the affiliate is no longer authorized to sell it</li>
            <li value="3">Terminating your relationship with the affiliate<br /></li>
        </ul>
        <h5>To make affiliate level changes:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Go to the Affiliates page and do a search for the desired affiliate, if it's not already showing.</li>
            <li value="2">Click the <span class="strong">Affiliate ID</span> field for the affiliate that requires changes. The Affiliate Detail page appears. </li>
            <li value="3">If for some reason you choose to terminate your relationship with the affiliate, click <span class="strong">Terminate </span>and follow the instructions provided.</li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>To delete one of your SKUs so that the affiliate is no longer authorized to sell it, click the appropriate <span class="strong">Delete </span>button and follow the instructions provided. </p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> Even after you have deleted a SKU, the affiliate will be able to sign up for it again if you continue to list the SKU in affiliates.esellerate.net. To be able to control which affiliates can sign up for a SKU, go to its Available SKU Detail page and clear the <span class="strong">List in affiliates.esellerate.net</span> check box. A sign-up URL will appear. You can provide that URL to affiliates that you want to have sign up for the SKU.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p><a name="affiliateskudetail"></a>To change or lock/unlock a commission rate that the affiliate earns for selling one of your SKUs, click the appropriate <span class="strong">SKU ID</span> field. The SKU Detail page appears. (This page provides SKU information that is specific to the individual affiliate.) You then have the following options:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">To access the SKU's global settings, click the <span class="strong">SKU ID</span> field. Be sure to note that any changes you make to these settings will affect the SKU in all associations.</li>
                    <li value="2">To set the commission rate that the individual affiliate earns for selling the SKU, click <span class="strong">Set Commission</span> and follow the instructions provided.</li>
                    <li value="3">If you would like to lock the affiliate's commission rate so that changes made at the Available SKU Detail page will not affect it, click <span class="strong">Lock</span>. This will protect the rate from unintended changes while still allowing you to change the rate on an individual basis. (You can unlock the rate at any time by clicking <span class="strong">Unlock</span>.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When you're finished making changes, click <span class="strong">Return to Affiliate Details</span>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
