        <h2><a name="kanchor108"></a>Submitting SKUs</h2>
        <p>Use the Available SKUs page to manage the SKUs you make available for affiliate sale. SKUs that you add through this page will be listed in the Available Products section of the  eSellerate Affiliates web site. (For special circumstances, you can offer SKUs to affiliates without listing the SKUs on the affiliates web site.)<br /></p>
        <h4>Submit SKUs</h4>
        <p>To submit SKUs for affiliates to sell, click <span class="strong">Add </span>and follow the instructions provided.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> When adding to your Available SKUs, you will only be able to select active SKUs that are assigned to Web Store eSellers and/or Embedded Web Store eSellers. Other eSeller options for the SKU will be available when you set up its Available SKU Detail page.<br /></p>
        <p>Once you have set up your Available SKUs and Affiliate Contact Information, you will receive e-mail notification each time an affiliate signs up to sell one of your SKUs. (If you have opted to manually approve each new affiliate, the first e-mail you receive from the affiliate will be the request to sell.)</p>
        <h4><a name="availableskudetail"></a>Complete the Available SKU Detail page<br /></h4>
        <p>The Available SKU Detail page gives you control over details such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">How the SKU is presented in the Available Products section of the  eSellerate Affiliates web site</li>
            <li value="2">Whether the SKU is included when affiliates sign up to sell all of your products</li>
            <li value="3">The default commission rate offered to affiliates for selling the SKU</li>
            <li value="4">The ability to extend your affiliate sales opportunities through try and buy functionality</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>To set up the Available SKU Detail page:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">If desired, you can click the <span class="strong">SKU ID</span> field and make changes to the SKU's global settings. Be sure to note that any changes you make to these settings will affect the SKU in all associations.</li>
            <li value="2">In the <span class="strong">Platform</span> list, select a platform for the SKU.</li>
            <li value="3">In the <span class="strong">WebStore</span> list, select the <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span> Web Store or Embedded Web Store that should process sales made through affiliate "Buy" links to the SKU. (Also see <a href="Affiliates_CustomOnlineS.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">Customizing Online Stores for Select Affiliates</a>.) </li>
            <li value="4">In the <span class="strong">Commission </span>field, enter the default commission rate. (After an approved affiliate signs up to sell the SKU, you can set the affiliate's individual commission rate from its Affiliate SKU Detail page.) </li>
            <li value="5">When applicable, use the eST Download feature to enable affiliates to display "Try" links to the SKU. See <a href="Affiliates_eSTDownloads.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">Creating eST Downloads</a>.</li>
            <li value="6"><a name="listingoptions"></a>To list the SKU in the Available Products section of the  eSellerate Affiliates web site (affiliates.esellerate.net), select the <span class="strong">List in affiliates.esellerate.net</span> check box. (This option is selected by default.) If you choose to not list the SKU, clear the  check box. A sign-up URL appears. You can provide this URL to affiliates that want to sign up to sell the individual SKU.</li>
            <li value="7"><a name="setcategory"></a>Click <span class="strong">Set Category</span> and set at least one category for displaying the SKU in the Available Products section. You can set up to four categories. Setting the category is required even if you did not enable the "List in affiliates.esellerate.net" option for step 6. </li>
            <li value="8">Affiliates can sign up to sell your individual products, or all of your products. To include the SKU in the automatic sign-up process when affiliates request to sell all of your products, select the <span class="strong">Automatically sign up affiliates to this SKU</span> check box.  You must select this check box if you enabled the "List in affiliates.esellerate.net" option for step 6.</li>
            <li value="9">In the <span class="strong">Message to Affiliates</span> field, enter a message that will entice affiliates to sell the SKU.</li>
            <li value="10">
                <p><a name="imageurl"></a>Images that you specify in the <span class="strong">Image URL</span> fields will be available for affiliates to use for two purposes: displaying "Buy" links to the SKU, and displaying links to Landing Pages that feature the SKU, when applicable. </p>
                <p><span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span> makes several different images available for you to use. To select one, click <span class="strong">Select Image</span>.</p>
                <p>You can also enter or paste in URLs for your own standard web images.</p>
                <p>Also note:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">You can use the following example of standard image types and sizes as a guideline for your own images:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li value="1"><span class="strong">Image URL 1:</span> Box shot (160 x 160 pixels)</li>
                        <li value="2"><span class="strong">Image URL 2: </span>Screenshot 1 (600 x 400 pixels)</li>
                        <li value="3"><span class="strong">Image URL 3: </span>Screenshot 2 (600 x 400 pixels)</li>
                        <li value="4"><span class="strong">Image URL 4: </span>Product icon (32 x 32 pixels)</li>
                        <li value="5"><span class="strong">Image URL 5: </span>"Headline" banner (468 x 60 pixels)</li>
                        <li value="6"><span class="strong">Image URL 6: </span>"Skyscraper" banner (728 x 90 pixels)</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li value="11"><a name="landingpages"></a><a name="kanchor109"></a>(Steps 11-14 apply only if you use Landing Pages.) In the Affiliate Listing Options section under "Landing Pages," click one of the lists and select a Landing Page.</li>
            <li value="12">When a confirmation appears, click <span class="strong">OK</span>.</li>
            <li value="13">If you selected a customizable Landing Page (something other than the EZ Landing Page), the Query String Parameters field will display all external variables found in that page. Some of these variables will be prefilled with values. Enter a value for any variable that doesn't include one by default, with the exception of AffID and AT. You should leave the values for AffID and AT blank.</li>
            <li value="14">If you selected the EZ Landing Page, there is nothing that you are required to add to the Query String Parameters field. However, if you specify a tracking ID, <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span> will record that ID along with other order details whenever the "Buy" or "Try" links in the Landing Page generate a sale. You can then use the SKU Sales by Date Range report to find sales that involved the tracking ID. If you would like to use the tracking ID option, enter an ID immediately after "&amp;PT=" in the Query String Parameters field. The ID can be any alphanumeric name you choose, up to a 100-character limit. (Though you can enter a value for PT if desired, you should leave the values for AffID and AT blank.) Repeat steps 11-14 to assign as many Landing Pages as needed (up to a limit of six).</li>
            <li value="15">Click <span class="strong">Save Changes</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> When checking out details about your SKU, affiliates will see the Short Description and "More Info" Text you specified for the SKU on the Basic tab of the SKU Detail page. If you use an image (IMG) HTML tag in those descriptions to point to an image on your unsecured (http://) web site, please note that affiliates will see the following message when viewing your SKU details: "Security Information: This page contains both secure and nonsecure items. Do you want to display the nonsecure items?" The reason for this message is that your SKU information is stored on a secure server as part of <span class="PrimaryCompanyName">eSellerate</span> security measures, while the referenced image is stored on a nonsecure server. Online help for affiliates.esellerate.net advises affiliates to click Yes and continue when the message appears.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span>&#160;When an affiliate signs up to sell all of your products, all SKUs that support automatic sign-up will be added to the affiliate's account (with either active or pending status). The same rule applies for SKUs that you offer in the future. The affiliate will receive e-mail notification for each automatic sign-up that occurs.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
