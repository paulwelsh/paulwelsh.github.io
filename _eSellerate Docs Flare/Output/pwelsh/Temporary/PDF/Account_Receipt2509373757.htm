        <ol>

This information will appear in all receipts generated for you by eSellerate sales (with the exception of the override option described later in this step). Required fields are marked with an asterisk.</p>
                <p>Information you enter here will be used in the following places:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">Receipts created by all eSellers at the conclusion of a purchase</li>

                </ul>
                <p>In special cases that require different receipt information, you can override these defaults for individual eSellers. This option is available through the Receipt Information section of an eSeller's Detail page.</p>

                <p><a name="Order_Confirm_Email"></a>At the conclusion of a purchase, eSellerate sends the customer an e-mail that contains an order summary and support information. By default, the introductory text for this e-mail is as follows:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Dear &lt;customer name&gt;,</p>
                    <p>Thank you for purchasing from &lt;publisher name&gt;. You can find detailed information about your order under "ORDER SUMMARY" below. If you have any questions about your purchased product(s), please refer to the contact information under "&lt;product support header&gt;".</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>If you would like to replace the "Thank you for purchasing ..." paragraph with your own information, you can enter the replacement text in the field provided for <span class="strong">Order Confirmation E-mail Introductory Text</span>.

                <p>Once you fulfill an order, eSellerate sends the customer an e-mail that contains a shipping summary and support information. By default, the introductory text for this e-mail is as follows:</p>

                    <li value="1">If you select the <span class="strong">Include Receipt Information</span> check box, the product support information in the Order Confirmation and Order Fulfillment e-mail messages will include whatever you entered for receipt information.

        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> You can also enter text to accompany any SKU's information in the Order Confirmation and Order Fulfillment e-mail messages. This enables you to provide your customers with information specific to each SKU in their order. The option is available on the Advanced tab of the SKU Detail page, as "Order E-mail and Receipt Text." For details, see <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/SKU_Management/SKU_Advanced.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="Setting the SKU's Advanced Properties (Optional)"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Setting the SKU's Advanced Properties (Optional)" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.			</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> The Order Confirmation and Order Fulfillment e-mail messages include information specific to the customers' payment method.
		<br /><br />For credit card, e-check (ACH) or international wire payments, there will be variations of the following text: "IMPORTANT: Your payment method will show a transaction from DRI*MERCHANTDESCRIPTOR in the amount of $XX.XX." (Each publisher has a unique merchant descriptor, which would display in the place listed here.)
			<br /><br />For PayPal payments, the text will appear as follows: "IMPORTANT: Your PayPal account will show a transaction from eSellerate in the amount of $XX.XX."
			<br /><br />For purchase orders, the text will appear as follows: "IMPORTANT: Our terms are "Due Upon Receipt". Please remit payment in the amount of $XX.XX to eSellerate. All funds must be in US dollars drawn on a US bank."</p>
        <h3 MadCap:xrefTargetName="$$xref$$_10" MadCap:sourceTitle="Entering Default Receipt Information"><a name="FormattingCustom"></a>Formatting Your Custom Text</h3>
        <p>The Customized Order E-mail section provides three separate places where you can enter your own text to replace the default values: Order Confirmation E-mail Introductory Text, Order Fulfillment E-mail Introductory Text, and Product Support Header and Text. If you choose to enter your own text in any of these places, we recommend using plain text instead of HTML. Plain text is the better choice for ensuring that the e-mails will look good for all your customers. If you choose to use HTML, there are a few things to note. First, any HTML tags that you enter will be stripped before the text is displayed in clients that are set up to accept plain text only. Also, you should carefully test the plain-text and HTML versions of the e-mails in multiple clients. Finally, be sure to close your tags to prevent formatting issues that could affect the entire e-mail message.</p>
