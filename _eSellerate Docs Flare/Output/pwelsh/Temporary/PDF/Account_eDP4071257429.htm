            <MadCap:keyword term="eSellerate Download Protection;eDP" />Presenting the eSellerate Download Protection (eDP) Option to Customers</h3>
        <p>Available for $4.99 per order,  eSellerate Download Protection service (eDP) guarantees customers the ability to re-download exact copies of the files they purchased, for one year from the date of purchase.</p>
        <h5>General Information on eDP</h5>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">eDP is supported for Web Store and Embedded Web Store eSellers only.</li>
            <li value="2">There is nothing that you need to do to enable eDP, and you cannot disable it.</li>
            <li value="3">eDP is available for purchase whenever the shopping cart contains at least one SKU that involves an electronic download.</li>
            <li value="4">When the customer adds the first eligible SKU to the shopping cart, a hyperlinked "eDP available" graphic displays next to the SKU name, and eDP is automatically added to the cart. The customer can click the "eDP available" graphic to learn more about the option. If the customer removes eDP from the cart, eDP appears as a purchase option at the bottom of the page. (This is the default behavior for presenting eDP as a purchase option. For an alternative, see <MadCap:xref href="#AutoAddeDP" MadCap:xrefTarget="$$xref$$_11"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Automatically Adding the eDP SKU to the Shopping Cart" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.)</li>
            <li value="5">eDP will always be sorted to the bottom of the shopping cart.</li>
            <li value="6">When purchased, eDP covers all SKUs in the order that involve electronic downloads.</li>
            <li value="7">The Order Confirmation e-mail instructs customers to visit the  eSellerate After-Purchase Services web page at <a href="http://store.esellerate.net/support" target="_blank">http://store.esellerate.net/support</a> to re-download the products they purchased.</li>
            <li value="8">eSellerate creates one eDP SKU per publisher. You cannot access or edit this SKU.</li>
            <li value="9">The eDP SKU will appear in order receipts and the Order Confirmation e-mail.</li>
            <li value="10">eSellerate reports treat the eDP SKU like any other SKU.</li>
            <li value="11">Downloads that are covered by eDP are known as "insured."</li>
            <li value="12">With the exception of returns, insured downloads are always available for one year, regardless of any changes you make to the web stores and SKUs involved in the original orders. (Returned items are never available for re-downloading.)</li>
            <li value="13">There is no charge to you for the bandwidth used when your customers re-download insured downloads.</li>
            <li value="14">To prevent software piracy,  eSellerate imposes a daily re-download limit on insured downloads. If a customer exceeds that re-download limit, the following message displays: "The re-download limit for this order has been exceeded. If you have questions about this error message, please contact customerservice@esellerate.net."</li>
            <li value="15">When testing your Web Store eSellers in preview mode, eDP purchases do not result in actual insured downloads, just as the simulated payment processing does not result in actual charges.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>eDP Pricing and Order Processing</h5>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">eSellerate controls the base price of the eDP SKU.</li>
            <li value="2">You earn $1 for each eDP SKU sold.</li>
            <li value="3">Affiliates do not share in eDP SKU revenue.</li>
            <li value="4">In contrast to eCD (another  eSellerate service available to your web store customers), coupon discounts do not apply to the eDP SKU amount.</li>
            <li value="5">eSellerate charges sales tax or Value Added Tax (VAT) on the sale of eDP SKUs, when applicable.</li>
            <li value="6">eSellerate does not charge a processing fee on the sale of eDP SKUs.</li>
            <li value="7">When processing orders, eSellerate adds its portion of the eDP SKU sale to the processing fee. This allows eSellerate reports and notices that show an eDP SKU sale to always reflect your net revenue ($1) on that sale.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>eDP Returns</h5>
        <p>You can use the Returns editor to credit customers for the entire price of the eDP SKU (but not a portion of the price).</p>
        <p>When you return an eDP SKU, the following events occur:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">The entire price is credited to the customer.</li>
            <li value="2">eSellerate's portion of the sale is removed from the processing fee.</li>
            <li value="3">A $1 negative adjustment is made to your net revenue on the sale.</li>
            <li value="4">The download guarantee is removed for all downloads in the order.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You cannot specify a restocking fee on a returned eDP SKU.</p>

        <p>The  eSellerate Download Protection service area of the Return &amp; Privacy Policies page provides a check box for determining how web stores present the eDP option when a customer adds the first eligible SKU to the shopping cart:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">If the box is checked (the default), a hyperlinked "eDP available" graphic will display next to the SKU name, and eDP will be automatically added to the cart. The customer can click the "eDP available" graphic to learn more about the option. If the customer removes eDP from the cart, eDP will appear as a purchase option at the bottom of the page.</li>
            <li value="2">If the box is unchecked, a hyperlinked "eDP available" graphic will display next to the SKU name, and eDP will appear as a purchase option at the bottom of the page. The customer can click either the "eDP available" graphic or a "What is eDP" link to learn more about the option.</li>
        </ul>
