        <h5>To create a coupon:</h5>
        <p>From the Coupon List page, click <span class="strong">New</span>. The Coupon Details page appears.<br /><img src="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Output/pwelsh/Temporary/PDF/PDF_1ABAD487/Resources/Images/advanced_coupons.jpg" class="PWimg" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" /></p>
        <h4>Enter an ID</h4>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">In the <span class="strong">Coupon ID</span> field, enter a descriptive coupon ID. This is the ID your customers will enter at purchase time.</li>
            <li value="2">In the <span class="strong">Description</span> field, enter a description if desired. Text that you enter here is for your reference only, and will not be visible to your customers.</li>
            <li value="3">You can use the <span class="strong">Presets </span>list to automatically set some basic coupon properties, such as 10 percent off an order.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Set coupon requirements (optional)</h4>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">If you want this coupon to be valid only in conjunction with specific SKU purchases, make your selection from the list next to       <span class="strong">PART 1. Requirements</span>. Then do the following:<ul><li value="1">Click <span class="strong">Pick SKUs</span> and make your selections. For some purchase requirements, you will also need to enter the number of days or a date.</li><li value="2">To allow cross-sell discount purchases of your selected SKUs to count toward the coupon requirements, select the <span class="strong">Can be a Cross-Sell discounted SKU</span> check box. (This option is available for "current order" SKU purchases only.) If you do not enable this option, the selected SKUs must be purchased at regular price to count toward the coupon requirements.</li></ul></li>
            <li value="2">Enter the minimum number of items the shopping cart must contain.</li>
            <li value="3">Enter the minimum dollar order amount. Taxes and shipping will not count toward this figure.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Base the discount on specific item prices</h4>
        <p>Coupon discounts can be based on the total price of all items in the order, or they can be based on more specific item prices. For example, you could set up a 5-percent discount that applies only to the purchase price of certain SKUs. Or you could exclude those same SKUs so that their purchase prices never affect the discount. You can also use this feature to easily set up a free shipping coupon.</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Make your "based on" selection from the list next to <span class="strong">PART 2. Discount Based On</span>.</li>
            <li value="2">When applicable, click <span class="strong">Pick SKUs</span> and make your selections. </li>
            <li value="3">Specify the discount or the shipping method as required.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Important:</span> As noted under <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/Advanced_Sales_Options/Advanced_CouponNotes.htm#AdvancedSalesOptions_3786514807_268719" MadCap:xrefTarget="Notes on Coupons"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Notes on Coupons" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>, coupon discounts always apply as a negative adjustment to the entire order amount (minus the eSellerate Download Protection service (eDP) SKU amount when applicable). Consequently, though you can base your discount on the purchase price of certain SKUs and exclude the prices of others, you cannot prevent a SKU from receiving a portion of the discount. For example, assume that SKU 1, SKU 2 and SKU 3 cost $10 each, and you set up a coupon discount based on the purchase of SKU 1 and SKU 2, with 10 percent off each SKU. If a customer uses your coupon when purchasing all three SKUs, eSellerate applies the 10-percent discount off the prices of SKU 1 and SKU 2 to the entire order amount. The result is a $2 discount distributed between three $10 SKUs, which reduces the price of each SKU to $9.33. This behavior could be especially noteworthy if you used the eSellerate SplitPay program to pay your partners a portion of the sales proceeds from SKU 3, because those payments might be lower than expected.</p>
        <h4>Set usage limitations (optional)</h4>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">You can limit coupon usage to one time only, one time only per e-mail or the first <i>n</i> customers. Make your selection from the list next to <span class="strong">PART 3. Usage Limitations</span>.</li>
            <li value="2">When applicable, enter the number of customers.</li>
            <li value="3">Enter the start date (mm/dd/yyyy), if desired. All dates are based on U.S. Central Standard Time (GMT-6/CST, Central United States).</li>
            <li value="4">Enter the end date (mm/dd/yyyy), if desired.</li>
            <li value="5">To limit coupon usage to a single eSeller, make a selection from the provided list. Otherwise, you can allow the coupon to be used with all your qualified eSellers.</li>
            <li value="6">
                <p>To limit coupon usage to specific affiliates, enter the affiliate IDs. Be sure to enter the entire ID, including prefix ("AFF" for basic affiliates and "AFL" for eSellerate Affiliates). Separate multiple entries with commas.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><a name="usagelimitations"></a><span class="strong">Note:</span> When a customer uses one of your coupons, it takes at least 15 minutes for the information to reach all of eSellerate's redundant servers, or "stores." For that reason, any usage limitations that you set for a coupon—such as being valid for the first 50 customers—will be approximate rather than exact.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="7">If you are ready to activate this coupon for use, click <span class="strong">Save &amp; Activate</span>. Otherwise, click <span class="strong">Save</span>, which will allow you to activate the coupon later.</li>
        </ol>
