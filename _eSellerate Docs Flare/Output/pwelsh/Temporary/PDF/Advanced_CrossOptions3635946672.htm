        <p>On the Cross-Sell SKU Detail page, you can set the cross-sell options for the selected SKU. <br /><img src="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Output/pwelsh/Temporary/PDF/PDF_1ABAD487/Resources/Images/advanced_crosssell_detail.jpg" class="PWimg" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" /></p>
        <h5>To set a SKU's cross-sell options:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Text that you enter in the <span class="strong">Supplemental Message</span> field will immediately follow the SKU name. For example, if you enter "(Price Reduced)" and your SKU name is "Great Product," the resulting display would appear as follows: <span class="strong">Great Product</span> (Price Reduced!)</p>
                <p>You can also leave this field blank so that no supplemental message appears.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">The discount for this SKU can be a dollar amount or a percentage of the SKU price. In the <span class="strong">Discount</span> area, enter a discount amount and select either <span class="strong">Dollars </span>or <span class="strong">Percent</span>. To view a preview of how your discount information will display, click <span class="strong">Update</span>.</li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Cross-sell SKUs have the option to display a More Info link, which will open a new page when clicked. This can be a text-based page (supported by all eSellers) or a web page (with some restrictions). To enable the web page option, complete the <span class="strong">More Info URL</span> field. The field accepts up to 245 characters.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> URLs that you enter must use "http://" in the web address. For example, "http://www.esellerate.net"</p>
                <p>If you leave this field blank, eSellerate will display this SKU's "More Info" Text as set on the Basic tab of the SKU Detail page. When no "More Info" Text exists, the More Info link will not display.</p>
                <p><span class="strong">Restrictions for Integrated eSellers</span>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">The More Info URL option is not available for Integrated eSellers running on Macintosh systems. These eSellers will always behave as if you had left the More Info URL field blank (see above).</li>
                    <li value="2">Integrated eSellers running on Windows systems require Internet Explorer 4.0 or later to use the More Info URL option. If this minimum requirement is not met, these eSellers will behave as if you had left the More Info URL field blank (see above).</li>
                    <li value="3">Although Integrated eSellers can display basic web pages to showcase your products, they are not full-featured web browsers. You will need to carefully test any of these eSellers that use the More Info URL option, and adjust the referenced web pages as required.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li value="4">The <span class="strong">Multi-Quantity Cross-Sell Sales</span> setting controls the quantities that customers can purchase for this cross-sell SKU. Your choices are as follows:<ul><li value="1">To prevent multi-quantity purchases of this SKU, you can accept the default setting, <span class="strong">Do Not Allow</span>.</li><li value="2">To limit purchases of this SKU to the same quantity as the SKU(s) that prompted the cross-sell offer, select <span class="strong">Limit Quantities Based on Primary Purchases</span>. For example, assume that SKU A and SKU B offer this SKU through the same cross-sell SKU group. If the shopping cart contents include quantity 2 of SKU A and quantity 1 of SKU B, the customer can purchase up to quantity 3 of this SKU (as a cross-sell item).</li><li value="3"><p>To set no limits on this SKU's purchase quantities, select <span class="strong">Allow Unlimited Quantities</span>.</p><p><span class="strong">Notes on this setting</span></p><ul><li value="1">If you set up a SKU to allow multi-quantity cross-sell sales (with limited or unlimited quantities), eSellerate will honor that setting even if you have set up the SKU at the SKU level to not allow multi-quantity sales. In instances when the SKU is not a cross-sell item, the SKU level setting still applies.</li><li MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print,Primary.Online" value="2">Integrated eSellers do not support multi-quantity cross-sell sales.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
            <li value="5">A cross-sell SKU with <span class="strong">Active </span>status will be available through your eSellers that are operating in active mode. Use <span class="strong">Preview </span>status to make the cross-sell SKU available for testing eSellers in preview mode. Select the check boxes for the statuses that you want to use (either, neither or both). See also <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/Advanced_Sales_Options/About_Active_and_Preview.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="About Active and Preview Modes"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"About Active and Preview Modes" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li value="6">When you're finished setting cross-sell options, click <span class="strong">Save Changes</span>.</li>
