        <p>When an eSeller uses tax-inclusive pricing, your net earnings for eCD Optional sales will be reduced unless you increase the eCD price to make up for the tax amounts. To make those adjustments, we recommend using Native Currency Pricing, which will allow you to set eCD pricing in your customers' preferred currencies. (The pricing that you set for eCD will apply to all your valid eCD eSellers, including those that do not use tax-inclusive pricing.)</p>
        <p>With tax-inclusive pricing, the total tax cost for eCD is subtracted from the publisher markup amount (see the eCD Configuration tab for that amount). For example, assume that the eSellerate eCD charge is $5 and the publisher markup is $5, for a total purchase price of $10. With a 7 percent tax rate, the total tax cost on $10 is $0.66. The publisher net earnings for a tax-inclusive sale would then be (5 − 0.66) = $4.34.</p>
