        <p>You can use the Returns editor to do any of the following in regard to subscription orders:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Cancel a subscription for all quantities purchased in that particular order, without issuing a refund </li>
            <li value="2">Issue a refund for an individual billing without canceling the subscription</li>
            <li value="3">Issue a refund for an individual billing and cancel the subscription for the quantity specified, which leaves the subscription active for any remaining quantities</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> Canceling a subscription through the Returns editor immediately deactivates any serial number associated with the subscription, and cancels all future billings and notifications. If you would prefer to allow the customer to access the subscription until the end of the current billing period, do not cancel the subscription through the Returns editor. Instead, you or the customer should cancel the subscription through eSellerate After-Purchase Services (<a href="http://store.esellerate.net/support" target="_blank">http://store.esellerate.net/support</a>), which allows the subscription to expire at the end of the current billing period.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><strong>Note:</strong> Customers can change the quantity of their subscriptions at renewal time, or at any time while the subscription is active (if you have "Allow Change of Quantity" turned on). As a result, when you return and cancel a subscription for the quantity specified (by using either Full Order Return or Partial Return/Refund), your changes will affect the total quantity that remains active for the subscription. For example, assume that an order included a subscription quantity of 5, and the customer later increased the quantity to 8, which resulted in a new order for the 3 additions. If you returned and canceled all quantities (5) for the first order, a quantity of 3 would remain active. Or you could return and cancel all quantities (3) for the second order, in which case a quantity of 5 would remain active.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> When you cancel a subscription through the Returns editor, eSellerate sends an e-mail notification to the customer. We do not send a notification to you (the publisher) in this instance because you processed the cancellation.<br /><br />When a subscription is canceled through eSellerate After-Purchase Services, eSellerate sends an e-mail notification to the publisher and the customer. We include you (the publisher) in these notifications to keep you informed when your customers cancel their subscriptions themselves.<br /></p>
