        <ul>
            <li value="1">Up-selling is supported for Web Store eSellers (with Custom Layouts or Standard Layouts) and Embedded Web Store eSellers only. </li>
            <li value="2">An up-sell SKU replaces the SKU that the customer had originally selected. For example, if the selection of SKU A prompts an up-sell offer for SKU B, the customer has the option to purchase SKU B instead of SKU A. </li>
            <li value="3">You can offer up-sell SKUs at a discount, or at full price. </li>
            <li value="4">Your customers can purchase multiple quantities of an up-sell SKU if you have set up the SKU that way at the SKU level.</li>
            <li value="5">With the default Custom Layouts functionality, there are two primary ways to present up-sell offers: <ul><li value="1">On a separate Up-Sell Page, which allows offering a single SKU only </li><li value="2">On the Cart Page, which allows offering multiple SKUs </li></ul></li>
            <li value="6">An up-sell SKU can present its own up-sell offers when the customer adds it to the cart. </li>
            <li value="7">Up-sell SKUs will display with the image and Short Description designated for them on the Basic tab of the SKU Detail page, when applicable.</li>
            <li value="8">Multiple up-sell SKU groups can display when appropriate. </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Advanced behaviors</h5>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Before adding an up-sell SKU to the shopping cart, the customer must agree to any associated terms of sale. </li>
            <li value="2">Terms of sale behavior differs slightly depending on whether you present up-sell offers on the Up-Sell Page or the Cart Page. If you use the Up-Sell Page, terms of sale will display immediately after the customer says yes or no to the up-sell offer. Those terms can be for the up-sell SKU, or the SKU that the customer originally selected. If you use the Cart Page, terms of sale will display immediately after the customer clicks the Buy button. </li>
            <li value="3">When both up-sell and volume discounts apply, eSellerate uses the discount that results in the lower price. </li>
            <li value="4">An up-sell SKU will always be added to the cart with a quantity of 1, regardless of the quantity set for the SKU it is replacing. (The exception is if that SKU is already in the cart, in which case the quantity will increment by one if the SKU allows multi-quantity sales.) Once the SKU is in the cart, the customer can increase the quantity if the SKU allows it. </li>
            <li value="5">When multi-quantity sales are allowed, the last SKU added to the cart determines the pricing. For example, assume that SKU B is available as a regular catalog item for $25, and as an up-sell from some other SKU for the discounted price of $20. If the customer first adds the regular catalog item to the shopping cart, and later adds the up-sell version, the unit price becomes $20, and the quantity increases to 2. </li>
            <li value="6">You can present up-sell offers for SKUs that you prefill into the shopping cart. (See "Cautions" below for limitations of using prefill in conjunction with the Up-Sell Page.) </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Cautions</h5>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">eSellerate displays all up-sell offers that apply to the customer's purchase selections. To avoid issues such as showing two different discounts for the same up-sell SKU, you will need to pay close attention to your configurations. </li>
            <li value="2">Setting up a SKU to not allow multi-quantity sales can prevent an up-sell from being added to the cart. For example, assume that SKU A is available as a regular catalog item, and as an up-sell from some other SKU. If the customer first adds the regular catalog item to the shopping cart, and later attempts to add the up-sell version, the cart contents do not change because the SKU in the cart already has a quantity of 1. In that same scenario, if the SKU allows multi-quantity sales, the quantity of the SKU in the cart increases by 1. </li>
            <li value="3">Some limitations of displaying up-sell offers on a separate Up-Sell Page, as opposed to the Cart Page, are: <ul><li value="1">The Up-Sell Page can promote a single SKU only. </li><li value="2">When the customer selects a SKU that has both up-sell and cross-sell SKU groups assigned to it, eSellerate presents the up-sell offer, and ignores the cross-sell assignment. </li><li value="3">If you use the up-sell feature in conjunction with prefill, you should prefill no more than one SKU into the shopping cart at a time. In this scenario, the number of SKUs that you prefill will affect the store behavior as follows: <ul><li value="1">If you prefill one SKU, the Up-Sell Page will display first, followed by the terms of sale (when applicable), and then the page designated as First Page.</li><li value="2">If you prefill multiple SKUs, eSellerate will add the SKUs to the cart without displaying the Up-Sell Page or any of the associated up-sell offers. <br /><br />See also <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/Layouts/Layouts_CustomPrefillDat.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="Prefilling Data"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Prefilling Data" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.</li></ul></li><li value="4">The customer has only one chance to take advantage of the up-sell offer presented on the Up-Sell Page. If the customer declines the offer, the up-sell SKU does not appear again. </li></ul></li>
            <li value="4">Affiliates receive sales credit only on SKUs that they have signed up to sell. Because up-sell SKUs replace the customer's original selection, a good way to ensure proper sales credit is for your affiliates to sign up to sell all your SKUs. </li>
            <li value="5">eSellerate does not support presenting up-sell offers when the customer adds a cross-sell SKU to the cart.</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print,Primary.Online" value="6">This note applies to Embedded Web Store eSellers only. If you use the up-sell feature in conjunction with eSellerate Product Activation, all SKUs that you offer in a given up-sell opportunity should use the same Product Activation Set ID. This is because the Product Activation Set ID that your eSeller passes for Purchase or CheckForUpdate API calls is the one eSellerate uses for activation, even if the customer ends up purchasing an up-sell SKU instead of the original selection. By coding related eSellers to pass the same Product Activation Set ID, you can avoid problems with validating activations after an up-sell purchase.</li>
