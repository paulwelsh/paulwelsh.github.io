        <p>The eSellerate system provides two ways to test eST downloads:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">The Test eST Download function, which can be used prior to the release to affiliates. </li>
            <li value="2">The Test eST Trial Version function, which is for use after the release to affiliates.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> A test eST download will be identical to the one used by affiliates, except it will use "AFLTESTOK" as the affiliate ID.<br /></p>
        <h5>To test an eST download:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">From the Test eST Download page, select the SKU to associate with this test. It must be the same SKU offered by the download you select in the next step.</li>
            <li value="2">Select the download file you wish to test.</li>
            <li value="3">Click <span class="strong">Test eST Download</span>.</li>
            <li value="4">Launch the downloaded file, which will write an affiliate-specific URL to the registry. This URL is stored as the "URL" (string) value of the registry key "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\eSellerate\Affiliates\PUB123456789\SKU123456789" </li>
            <li value="5">Verify that your application is retrieving and making use of the correct affiliate information, which can be done in one of three ways: <ul><li value="1">To test an eST download that delivers an Integrated eSeller, launch the eSeller and initiate a purchase. When the Software Delivery Wizard appears, click <span class="strong">Start</span>. At any screen you choose, press <span class="strong">Control+Shift</span> and click on the "Powered by eSellerate" logo.

At any screen you choose, press <span class="strong">Control+Shift</span> and click on the globe in the browser status bar. The web store URL displayed should include the correct SKU RefNum and the "AFLTESTOK" affiliate ID.</li><li value="3">If your eST download uses an In-App Buy URL, you should initiate a purchase and verify that the URL includes the correct SKU RefNum and the "AFLTESTOK" affiliate ID.</li></ul></li>
