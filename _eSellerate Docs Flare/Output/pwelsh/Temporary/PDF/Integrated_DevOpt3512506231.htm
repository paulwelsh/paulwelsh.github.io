        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span>&#160;The eSellerate (Integrated) SDK is a legacy option that was superseded by the Embedded Web Store SDK. It is not recommended for use with new projects. The Embedded Web Store SDK provides many advanced features that are not available with the legacy option, including fully customizable stores and universal binary support for Macs.</p>
        <p>Integrated eSellers call on the eSellerate Engine—a shared library located on the customer's computer system—to perform various functions. How you interface your application with the eSellerate Engine depends on your development environment. The options are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p><span class="strong">Library for Macintosh applications.</span> This option allows you to compile the interface code directly into your Macintosh application. Just include the necessary header and library files in your, typically, CodeWarrior project. </p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> This is not a Universal (universal binary) solution.</p>
                <p>See "eSellerate Libraries for Macintosh" in <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print">Chapter 2 of the eSellerate SDK Reference</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p><span class="strong">Library for Windows applications. </span>This option allows you to compile the interface code directly into your Windows application. Just include the necessary header and library files in your Visual C++ project. </p>
                <p>See "eSellerate Libraries for Windows" in <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print">Chapter 2 of the eSellerate SDK Reference</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p><span class="strong">REALbasic plug-in for Macintosh and Windows applications.</span> This option allows you to compile the interface code directly into Macintosh and Windows applications that you develop with REALbasic. Just drop the plug-in into REALbasic's Plugins folder to make it available in your REALbasic project. </p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> For Macintosh applications – This is not a Universal (universal binary) solution.</p>
                <p>See "eSellerate Plug-in for REALbasic" in <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print">Chapter 2 of the eSellerate SDK Reference</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p><span class="strong">ActiveX control for Windows applications.</span> This option allows you to maintain the interface code as a shareable component separate from your COM-compatible Windows application. Just register the control and reference it in your project. Typical development tools include Visual Basic, CodeWarrior, Borland Delphi and Borland C++Builder. </p>
                <p>See "eSellerate ActiveX Control" in <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print">Chapter 2 of the eSellerate SDK Reference</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
