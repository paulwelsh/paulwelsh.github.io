        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note</span>: For orders placed prior to August 31, 2010, coupon and shipping amounts will not be specified at the line level in Full Order Returns and Partial Returns/Refunds. Instead, these items will be applied across the entire order, and will appear in the top section of the returns pages. The look and functionality will be the same as returns done prior to when eSellerate expanded the options for returns (in August 2010).</p>
        <p>With Partial Returns/Refunds you can return items and issue refunds on a line-by-line basis.</p>
        <p>After you select order items to return and click <span class="strong">Specify Return Details</span>, the  Specify Return Detail page appears.</p>
        <h4>Return Details</h4>
        <p>Complete the Return Details section as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><span class="strong">Return Date</span> – The return date will use the current date by default. You can change the date if desired.</li>
            <li value="2"><span class="strong">RMA&#160;Number</span> – If the return will use an RMA number, you can enter that number here (optional).</li>
            <li value="3"><span class="strong">Reason for Return</span> – Click this list to select a return reason. If you need to edit or create a return reason before you make your selection, click the <span class="strong">Edit Return Reasons</span> icon. When you're finished, you will need to navigate back to the Specify Return Detail page.</li>
            <li value="4"><span class="strong">Comment</span> – Enter a comment (optional).</li>
            <li value="5"><span class="strong">Return E-mail Sender Address</span> – This field allows you to specify the "From" address for the notification e-mail that eSellerate will send to the customer when you finish processing this return. You can accept the default address, or enter a different one.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Selected Items</h4>
        <p>For each selected item there will be a detailed listing of the amounts you are about to return. Depending on the item, you may have additional choices such as the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><span class="strong">Restocking Fee</span> – You can use this field to specify an amount to be deducted from the customer's refund. For your consideration in determining a restocking fee, your transaction cost for the initial sale will be shown.</li>
            <li value="2"><span class="strong">Restocking Fee Refund</span> – After you charge a restocking fee, you can go back to the order and refund all or part of the fee. Enter the refund amount in this field.</li>
            <li value="3">
                <p><span class="strong">Quantity</span> – When the item quantity is greater than one, you can specify the quantity to return.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note</span>: The Refundable Unit Amount is the amount per quantity available for refunding after all prior Satisfaction Refunds. This figure is not always equal to the full unit amount because a Satisfaction Refund can be an arbitrary amount. For example, assume that a prior Satisfaction Refund causes $2.00 to be refunded from a $10.00 item. The Refundable Unit Amount for that item would then be $8.00.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4"><span class="strong">Cancel subscription for quantity specified</span> – If you leave this option selected, your return will cancel the subscription for the quantity specified, while leaving the subscription active for any quantities that are still available for returning.</li>
            <li value="5"><span class="strong">Return Shipping</span> – The shipping amount (plus tax when applicable) for the item will be shown. To return that amount, leave the <span class="strong">Return Shipping</span> check box selected.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you're reading to proceed and look over your return information before submitting it, click <span class="strong">Verify Return Information</span>.</p>
        <h4>Verify Return Information</h4>
        <p>To correct any return information listed, use your browser's back button and make the changes before proceeding.</p>
        <p>When the return information is correct, click <span class="strong">Process The Return</span>.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note</span>: If the payment type for the order was international wire, you will have additional steps to complete at this time. See <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/Order_Management/Orders_Returning.htm#ReturningWire" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="$$xref$$_7"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Returning International Wire Orders" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>The Return Detail page will display a summary of the return. Be sure to note the Status field, which will indicate one of the following statuses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Processed</li>
            <li value="2">Submitted</li>
            <li value="3">Pending</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more information on these statuses, see <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/Order_Management/Orders_Returning.htm#ProcessedVersus" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="$$xref$$_5"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Processed versus Submitted versus Pending Returns" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
