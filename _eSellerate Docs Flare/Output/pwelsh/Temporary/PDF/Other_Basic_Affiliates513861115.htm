        <p>To help you extend your sales opportunities into more channels, eSellerate supports affiliate sales. This support is available at two different levels to suit your individual needs:.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Basic Affiliates (see below) offers simple affiliate sales tracking. You take care of recruiting affiliates and paying them for their sales.</li>
            <li value="2">eSellerate Affiliates is a full-featured affiliates program. eSellerate markets your products to potential affiliates and handles all payments. See <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/eSellerate_Affiliates/Affiliates_Joining.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="Joining eSellerate Affiliates"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Joining eSellerate Affiliates" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Basic Affiliates</h3>
        <p>With this option, your affiliates can link to virtually any place in your web store(s), and eSellerate will capture their sales information. You can then use our various reports to determine what to pay each affiliate.</p>
        <p>To set up basic affiliate selling:</p>
        <h4>Create a basic affiliate record</h4>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Click the <span class="strong">Basic Affiliates</span> tab. The Basic Affiliate List page appears.</li>
            <li value="2">Click <span class="strong">New</span>. The Basic Affiliate Detail page appears. (This page lists all Web Store eSellers for the account.)<br></br><img src="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Output/pwelsh/Temporary/PDF/PDF_1ABAD487/Resources/Images/other_basic.jpg" class="PWimg" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print"></img></li>
            <li value="3">Enter the affiliate's contact information in the fields provided.</li>
            <li value="4">You can use statuses (active or inactive) to organize how your affiliates appear in search lists. Also, your searches can include or exclude inactive affiliates. If you're ready to activate this affiliate, click <span class="strong">Save Changes</span>. (The <span class="strong">Active</span> check box is selected by default.) Otherwise, you can clear the <span class="strong">Active</span> check box, save this record and activate it later.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span>&#160;Basic affiliate statuses (active or inactive) are for list purposes only. With either status, the affiliate can sell your products, and eSellerate will track the sales.</p>
        <h4>Provide the affiliate with links to your stores</h4>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">From the Affiliate List page, select the affiliate and click <span class="strong">Edit</span>. The Affiliate Detail page appears.</li>
            <li value="2">You can provide this affiliate with links to any of your web stores. To select a store, click its <span class="strong">eSeller ID</span> field. A new page appears.</li>
            <li value="3">In the Basic Affiliate URLs information, click the "click here" link. A page displays basic affiliate links for the web store.</li>
            <li value="4">Copy any of the links displayed for this affiliate.</li>
            <li value="5">Send the links to the affiliate.</li>
            <li value="6">Repeat steps 2-5 to provide the affiliate with as many links as desired.</li>
        </ol>
