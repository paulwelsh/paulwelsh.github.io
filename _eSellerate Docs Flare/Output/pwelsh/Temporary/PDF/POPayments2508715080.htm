        <p>The ability to accept purchase order payments is available on request. If you are interested in using this option, please contact your assigned account executive.</p>

        <ul>
            <li value="1">Accepting purchase order payments is an option for Web Store eSellers (with Custom Layouts or Standard Layouts) only.          <![CDATA[ ]]></li>
            <li value="2">Purchase orders can be used as the payment method for subscription orders, but only under special circumstances. These special circumstances are when the following conditions are true for all subscriptions in the shopping cart:<ul><li value="1">The renewal policy is manual renewal.</li><li value="2">The duration and billing frequency are such that no recurring billings occur during the duration of the subscription. For example, if the duration is 12 months, the billing frequency must be every 12 months so there are no charges other than at the beginning of the subscription period, and optionally at the end of the period, if the customer manually renews.</li></ul></li>
            <li value="3">Purchase orders cannot be used when the order total is less than $250.</li>
            <li value="4">Payments must be in US dollars, and drawn on a US bank.</li>
            <li value="5">Custom Layouts created prior to when eSellerate introduced purchase order payments (August 31, 2010) will need updated. See <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/Layouts/Layouts_CustomPaymentMethods.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="Payment Methods Integration"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Payment Methods Integration" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Customer Experience</h4>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">For purchase orders to be available as a payment option, the following must be true:<ul><li value="1">If any of the items in the shopping cart use subscriptions, those subscriptions must meet the conditions listed under <MadCap:xref href="#Standards" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="$$xref$$_32"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Standards" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.</li><li value="2">The cart subtotal is at least $250.</li><li value="3">The selected currency is USD.</li></ul></li>
            <li value="2">Customers can enter a purchase order number if it is known, but that field is not required at the time of purchase.</li>
            <li value="3">While company name is typically not a required entry, customers must enter it when using this payment option. An error message will be displayed if the customer submits order information without entering a company name.</li>
            <li value="4">Aside from the purchase order number (if entered) and a company name, no special information is collected from the customer in regards to purchase order payments.</li>
            <li value="5">On the confirmation and receipt pages, customers will see the fax number and the mailing address for sending their purchase orders. Customers are encouraged to include their eSellerate order number when faxing or mailing their completed purchase orders.</li>
            <li value="6">When customers finish placing their orders, they will receive an order processing e-mail that explains a pending order has been set up, and repeats the details on where to send the purchase orders. This e-mail will show 	the order number, order date, publisher name, order item details and amount due.</li>
            <li value="7">Once the purchase order is received and the credit check is completed and approved, the customers will receive all normal correspondence that their order is complete. Downloads will become available, serial numbers will be issued, eCD orders will be sent, and so on. The publisher can complete fulfillment (ship items if needed) at this time.</li>
            <li class="Indent1" value="8">If the customer’s credit is declined, the customer will receive an e-mail that explains there was an issue with the order, and suggests using a different payment method.</li>
            <li value="9">Once a purchase order is approved, the customer still needs to send the payment to eSellerate.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Publisher Details</h4>
        <p>Publishers do not receive their payments on these orders until eSellerate receives and processes the customers' payments.</p>
