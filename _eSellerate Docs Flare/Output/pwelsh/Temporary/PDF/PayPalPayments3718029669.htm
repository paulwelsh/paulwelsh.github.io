            <MadCap:keyword term="PayPal" />PayPal Payments</h2>
        <p>PayPal is one of several payment methods that eSellerate supports. When customers choose the PayPal payment method, the eSellerate store directs them to PayPal's Express Checkout interface, where they can quickly authenticate their payments. After authentication, the customers return to the eSellerate store to complete their purchases.</p>
        <h5>Notes on eSellerate's PayPal support</h5>
        <ul>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print,Primary.Online" value="1">Accepting payments through PayPal is an option for Web Store eSellers (with Custom Layouts or Standard Layouts) and Embedded Web Store eSellers only. </li>
            <li value="2">eSellerate can accept PayPal payments in the following currencies: U.S. Dollar (USD), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Australian Dollar (AUD), Euros (EURO), British Pound (GBP) and Japanese Yen (JPY).</li>
            <li value="3">PayPal can be used as the payment method for subscription orders.</li>
            <li value="4">When customers authenticate their PayPal payments, they select a funding source. eSellerate does not allow customers to select eCheck as a funding source, because the time required for those payments to clear would delay fulfillment. </li>
            <li value="5">Although PayPal accounts can include information such as as billing address and shipping address, none of that information transfers to eSellerate when customers authenticate their payments. Customers still need to enter that information, just as they would for any other payment method that eSellerate supports.            <![CDATA[ ]]></li>
            <li value="6">When customers pay with PayPal, eSellerate captures all funds at the conclusion of the purchase, even when the order involves shipping. </li>
            <li value="7">PayPal conducts its own fraud screening when customers attempt to authenticate their payments. These precautions are in addition to the ones eSellerate takes to protect against fraud. </li>
            <li value="8">PayPal does not accept orders larger than $10,000 USD. When orders involve other currencies, PayPal enforces the limit based on the order equivalent of $10,000 USD. </li>
            <li value="9">When you conduct test purchases in preview mode, eSellerate provides a simulated PayPal Express Checkout interface for the authentication process. As with all preview orders, eSellerate's preview banner will display at the bottom of the store pages, and payment processing will execute in demo mode only, so that no charges occur. </li>
            <li value="10">The process that you follow to return PayPal orders is the same as for orders that involve other payment methods, such as credit cards. (See also <MadCap:xref MadCap:unresolvedLink="import-link:OrderManagement_2854091107_81547" href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/Order_Management/Orders_Returning.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="Returning Orders"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Returning Orders" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.)</li>
            <li value="11">As is the case with other payment methods, customers who pay for their purchases with PayPal should contact you directly if they want to request refunds. If they contact PayPal with those requests instead, the process is as follows: <ul><li value="1">When customers contact PayPal to request refunds or dispute charges to their accounts, PayPal assigns a case ID to each incident, and relays the information to eSellerate. </li><li value="2">eSellerate evaluates the information, and processes returns when appropriate. </li><li value="3">When these returned orders appear in eSellerate reports, the RMA Number field presents the case ID. An example case ID is PP-123-456-789. </li></ul></li>
            <li value="12">A key component of PayPal functionality is that the Custom Layout must have a Confirmation Page assigned. (You make page assignments on the Settings tab of the Custom Layouts Detail page.) Layouts that do not have a Confirmation Page assigned will not accept PayPal payments.</li>
            <li value="13">Another eSellerate offering related to PayPal is that we can direct your payments to a PayPal account. This offer is available only to publishers who also have adopted PayPal as an option for their customers. Payments are in U.S. dollars only. If you are interested in the PayPal payment option, please contact your assigned account executive. </li>
        </ul>
