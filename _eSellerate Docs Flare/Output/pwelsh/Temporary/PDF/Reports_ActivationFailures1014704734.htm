        <p>As a complement to the Serial Number Activation Attempts report—which shows activation attempt failures for one serial number at a time—this report allows exporting activation failures for all your serial numbers at once.</p>
        <h5>To run an Activation Failures Export:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Click the <span class="strong">Admin Reports</span> tab. The Admin Reports page appears.</li>
            <li value="2">Click <span class="strong">Activation Failures Export</span>. The Activation Failures Export page appears.<br /><img src="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Output/pwelsh/Temporary/PDF/PDF_1ABAD487/Resources/Images/report_act_failure.jpg" class="PWimg" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" /></li>
            <li value="3">This report can return results as a tab-delimited file or a comma-delimited file. Make your selection from the <span class="strong">Return Results As</span> <![CDATA[ ]]>list.</li>
            <li value="4">Use the <span class="strong">Date Range</span> list to narrow the scope of your report, if desired. You can also edit or enter dates in the <span class="strong">From </span>and <span class="strong">To </span>fields.</li>
            <li value="5">Click <span class="strong">Export Activation Failures</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>If you selected tab-delimited file results:</h5>
        <p>The resulting Save As dialog will display a default file name, which you can change if desired. In any case, you will need to change the file extension to ".txt" before saving the file (applies to both Windows and Macintosh platforms).</p>
        <p>You can now import the file into a database, or open it in a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel. (Because this is a basic text file, you may need to specify that the data is in tab-delimited format.)</p>
        <h5>If you selected comma-delimited file results:</h5>
        <p>The resulting Save As dialog will display a default file name, which you can change if desired. In any case, you will need to change the file extension to ".csv" before saving the file (applies to both Windows and Macintosh platforms).</p>
        <p>You can now import the file into a database, or open it in a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel. (If a program prompts you to specify a format for this data, select comma-delimited or comma-separated values.)</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span>&#160;The "ACTIVATION_COUNT" figures included in this report represent all successful activations for the respective serial numbers. The figures do not necessarily represent new, unique activations that would count against the total allowed activations. To find that type of information, see the serial number's Activation Details page. (See <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/Order_Management/Orders_Activation_Detail.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="Activation Details Page"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Activation Details Page" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.)</p>
