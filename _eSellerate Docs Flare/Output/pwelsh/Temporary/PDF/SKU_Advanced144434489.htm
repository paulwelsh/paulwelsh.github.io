                    <MadCap:keyword term="eCD:selecting delivery methods for SKUs" />The <span class="strong">Delivery Method</span> list determines whether eCD (CD fulfillment) is optional, or included with the SKU. </p>
                <p>If you select <span class="strong">Download Only (eCD Optional)</span>, your customers will have the option of receiving copies of their software purchases on a CD (provided that you also select an eCD file), in addition to downloading them from your web store. The remaining delivery methods always include eCD with the SKU, and vary according to whether you want to provide a download (<span class="strong">Download and eCD</span>) or no download (<span class="strong">eCD Only</span>).</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Caution:</span> Please carefully review your production costs for the <span class="strong">Download and eCD</span> and <span class="strong">eCD Only</span> delivery methods. See "eCD Included" on the eCD Configuration tab. </p>

                    <MadCap:keyword term="eCD:selecting eCD files for SKUs" />The <span class="strong">eCD File</span> list determines the file that is written to CD to represent the SKU when customers purchase eCD. </p>
                <p>If <span class="strong">Delivery Method</span> is set to <span class="strong">Download Only (eCD Optional)</span>, you can select <span class="strong">None </span>here when appropriate. Otherwise, you will need to select an eCD file. If you need to edit or create an eCD file (download) before you make your selection, click <span class="strong">Save</span>, and then click the <span class="strong">Edit Downloads</span> icon.</p>

                    <MadCap:keyword term="eCD:selecting eCD layouts for SKUs" />You can use eCD Layouts to control certain attributes of CDs that are delivered to your customers. Some examples are the Mailer Type (Standard Mailer, Custom Mailer or DVD Case) and the CD Face Image.</p>
                <p>To select a layout, use the <span class="strong">eCD Layout</span> list. You can select the default layout, or one that you uploaded. If you need to edit or create a layout before you make your selection, click <span class="strong">Save</span>, and then click the <span class="strong">Edit eCD Layouts</span> icon.</p>

All SKUs with that delivery method will use the same eCD Layout—the one set under "eCD&#160;Optional" on the eCD Configuration tab.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:&#160;</span>The default layout includes a Standard Mailer, a default image for the CD face, a basic Install Menu, and no trial files.</p>

                    <MadCap:keyword term="eCD:selecting eCD delivery frequency for SKUs" />When you sell this SKU through a subscription model and <span class="strong">Delivery Method</span> is set to <span class="strong">Download and eCD</span> or <span class="strong">eCD Only</span>, you can determine the eCD delivery frequency. There will always be a CD delivered with the initial order (the basis for all the frequency options), but you can also choose to have it delivered at additional times in the subscription period, including renewals and recurring billings.</p>
                <p>Use the <span class="strong">eCD Delivery Frequency</span> list to make your selection.                              <![CDATA[ ]]></p>

                <p>If you select the <span class="strong">Allow multi-quantity sales </span>check box, your customers will be able to purchase multiple quantities of this SKU. Clearing the check box will restrict the purchase quantity to one per transaction.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> If you set up this SKU to not allow multi-quantity sales, it is still possible to sell multiple quantities of this SKU as a cross-sell item. The setting for controlling multi-quantity cross-sell sales is available at the Cross-Sell SKU Detail level.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> <![CDATA[ ]]>Some types of serial number sets can indicate the SKU quantity purchased. When that option is available for a serial number set, you enable it by selecting the                                              <![CDATA[ ]]><span class="strong">Use Quantity</span> check box.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="11">
                <p>When you allow multi-quantity sales, selecting the <span class="strong">Issue serial numbers in ratio to quantity</span> check box instructs eSellerate to issue serial numbers in ratio to the SKU quantity purchased (assuming that you have assigned a serial number set to the SKU). If you clear this check box, your customer will receive one serial number that applies to all SKU quantities purchased.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> This option requires unique serial numbers. Be sure to keep this restriction in mind when you choose serial number sets for use with this SKU.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span>&#160;When a bundle/parent SKU has <span class="strong">Issue serial numbers in ratio to quantity</span> selected (and the purchase quantity is greater than 1 or <span class="strong">Issue &lt;x&gt; serial numbers per quantity</span> is greater than 1) you cannot activate a serial number for the SKU with a Purchase or CheckForUpdate call. An alternative is to get a serial number from the result data that is returned from the call, and activate it by calling ActivateSerialNumber.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span>&#160;There are some limitations to using the multiple serial numbers feature with Integrated eSellers. When multiple serial numbers are issued per quantity (see the explanation below), receipts for Integrated eSellers will not include the serial numbers. However, the order confirmation e-mails sent to customers will still include the serial numbers.<br /><br />Issuing multiple serial numbers per quantity occurs when <span class="strong">Issue serial numbers in ratio to quantity</span> is selected and either the purchase quantity is greater than 1, or <span class="strong">Issue &lt;x&gt; serial numbers per quantity </span>is greater than 1.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="12">When you issue serial numbers in ratio to the SKU quantity purchased, the number that you enter for <span class="strong">Issue &lt;x&gt; serial numbers per quantity</span> determines the ratio used. (This can allow you to sell SKUs as <MadCap:keyword term="multipacks" />multipacks.) For example, if you enter 10 for this option and the SKU quantity purchased is 2, eSellerate will issue 20 serial numbers.</li>
            <li value="13">
                <p>When you issue serial numbers in ratio to the SKU quantity purchased, selecting the <span class="strong">Issue serial numbers after purchase</span> check box  instructs eSellerate to defer issuing the serial numbers until after the purchase. In that case, order receipts and confirmation e-mails will tell your customers to visit eSellerate After-Purchase Services (<a href="http://store.esellerate.net/support" target="_blank">http://store.esellerate.net/support</a>) to get their serial numbers. The site allows customers to get as many serial numbers as needed at each visit, until they have used up all the available serial numbers.</p>
                <p>To be able to work with the "Issue serial numbers after purchase" option, serial number sets must meet the following criteria:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">They must be non-External. (See <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/SKU_Management/Serial_External.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="External"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"External" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.)</li>
                    <li value="2">They must have a Based On value, such as the customer's first and last name.</li>
                    <li value="3">If they are Armadillo serial number sets, they cannot have both a Based On value and a Prompted value.</li>
                    <li value="4">If they are Standard Enhanced serial number sets, their Delivery Method must be set to Serial Number.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If a serial number set does not meet the above criteria, eSellerate will issue all associated serial numbers at the time of purchase.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> For a SKU quantity of 1, eSellerate will issue the associated serial number at the time of purchase, regardless of whether or not <span class="strong">Issue serial numbers after purchase</span> is selected.</p>
