        <h3 MadCap:xrefTargetName="Web Store: Layout" MadCap:sourceTitle="Web Store: Layout"><a MadCap:generatedBookmark="TOC" name="Web Store: Layout"></a>Web Store: Layout</h3>
        <p>The Web Store Layout dialog box presents two primary layout options for your web store:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">The <MadCap:keyword term="Standard Layouts" />Standard Layouts option, which offers 14 different layouts that support limited customization </li>
            <li value="2">The Custom Layouts option, which offers several different default layouts that support major customization </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> With both of the primary layout options, you have the ability to localize the content (when using a localized layout). By default, a web store will display content in English only. If you plan to localize a store for other languages, you can specify those languages by clicking <span class="strong">Edit Language Selection</span>, and then following the instructions provided. (Edit Language Selection becomes available in the lower portion of the page after you save a new Web Store eSeller for the first time.)</p>
        <p>To select a layout option, do one of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <MadCap:keyword term="Standard Layouts:assigning to Web Stores" />To select a Standard Layout, follow the instructions below.</li>
            <li value="2">
                <MadCap:keyword term="Custom Layouts:assigning to Web Stores" />To select a Custom Layout, use the <span class="strong">Custom Layout</span> list. If you need to edit or create a layout before making this selection, you can click the <span class="strong">Edit Custom Layouts</span> icon to do so, and then return to the Web Store eSeller Detail page. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Information on how to select and customize a Standard Layout follows.</p>
        <h4>Banner Logo</h4>
        <p>To upload a banner logo for your store, click <span class="strong">Browse</span> (or <span class="strong">Choose File</span> if you're using Chrome or Safari) and then select the desired file. The upload will begin when you save your changes.</p>
        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> Banners that you upload to the <a>Sales Manager</a> must be in PNG, JPG, GIF or BMP formats. For best results, we recommend using 8-bit graphics with a resolution of 72 pixels per inch. While you can use larger images, your web store customers will experience longer loading times. <br /><br />The suggested maximum width and height for banner logos is 990 pixels and 150 pixels, respectively.<br /><br />You should not save these files in MacBinary format, even if you're uploading them from a Macintosh.<br /></p>
        <h4>Color Scheme</h4>
        <p>Your store will use the color scheme that you specify here. You can accept the default value of 666666, which is a shade of gray, or you can use a different color.</p>
        <p>To specify a color, either enter its hexadecimal color code (six digits, without the number sign), or click the color picker icon and make your selection from the color picker. The picker has three tabs, which work as follows: Within the <span class="strong">RGB</span> or <span class="strong">Named colors</span> tabs, you can click on a color to select it. Within the <strong>Color slider</strong> tab, once you have the desired RGB combination, you can click on the colored bar at the bottom (which shows the current color) to make your selection. </p>
        <p>You can preview your color selection in any of the Standard Layouts, as described below.</p>
        <h4>Layout Selection</h4>
        <p>Your choices for Standard Layouts include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Localized layouts</li>
            <li value="2">Boxes or rounded corners </li>
            <li value="3">Simple, single-page or multi-page </li>
            <li value="4">One or two columns </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can click any of the 14 images to view a preview of your web store with that layout, using the last color selection that you saved. The preview will also provide a description of the layout.</p>
        <p>To select a layout, click the radio button next to its image.</p>
