        <p>The General Attributes section of the Web Store eSeller Detail page includes the options described here.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><span class="strong">Store Name</span> – In the <span class="strong">Store Name</span> field, enter a name for this web store. The store name appears in the footer of all Standard Layouts and default Custom Layouts.</li>
            <li value="2"><span class="strong">Catalog Override</span> – The Catalog Override option can be useful if you plan to display your product catalog on your own web site, and direct customers to your eSellerate web store when they purchase or try out software. (See the More URL option at <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/Web_Store_eSellers/Web_Links.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="Web Store: Links"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Web Store: Links" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.) To help customers return to your web site after a software purchase or trial software download, you can control the behavior of the following navigation options within your web store:<ul><li value="1">The Continue Shopping button displayed prior to a purchase</li><li value="2"><p>The Continue Shopping link displayed after a purchase</p></li></ul><p>To set the override option, either select <span class="strong">Return To URL Specified</span> (and then enter the URL), or select <span class="strong">Return To Referring URL</span>.</p><p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Note:</span> If you use the override option, do not assign categories to your Web Store SKUs. By not using Web Store Categories, you will eliminate navigation by category, which would direct customers through the web store catalog pages rather than back to your web site. (See <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/Web_Store_eSellers/Web_AddingSKUs.htm#Web_Store_eSellers_2444435432_1010774" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="Adding Web Store SKUs"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Adding Web Store SKUs" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.)</p></li>

                    <MadCap:keyword term="US tax-inclusive pricing:enabling for Web Store eSellers" /><span class="strong">Use US Tax-Inclusive Pricing</span> – By default, the pricing in this store will exclude US tax, so that customers pay the unit prices plus any applicable US tax. Another option is to use US tax-inclusive pricing, which ensures your customers pay the exact prices shown on your store's catalog pages, with no additional costs when taxes apply. (In the shopping cart, US tax will be subtracted from the original prices, and the total tax amount will be displayed as a separate line item.) To include US tax in the pricing for this store, select the <span class="strong">Use US Tax-Inclusive Pricing</span> check box. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="file:///H:/Win/_eSellerate Docs Flare/Content/Miscellaneous/TaxInclusive.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:xrefTarget="Tax-Inclusive Pricing"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>"Tax-Inclusive Pricing" on page 1</u></span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
                <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Caution</span>:&#160;If you switch to tax-inclusive pricing, your net earnings will be reduced unless you increase the prices of all items in this store to make up for the tax amounts. To make those adjustments, we recommend using Native Currency Pricing, which will allow you to set pricing for SKUs, eCD and other items in your customers' preferred currencies.
