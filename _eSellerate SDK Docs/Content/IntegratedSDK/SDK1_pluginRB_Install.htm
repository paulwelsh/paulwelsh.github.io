        <h2>InstallEngine</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="InstallEngine" />Copies the eSellerateEngine from the application to its proper location, if one of the following conditions are true:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No engine is present.</li>
            <li>The engine that is present is older than the one carried by the application. In this case, the function replaces the older engine.</li>
            <li>The engine that is present has been altered. In this case, the function replaces the altered engine.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This approach requires that the eSellerateEngine is built into the application as a resource. While this makes the application file bigger, it allows the application to not depend on an installer or other strategy to ensure that the engine is in place.</p>
        <p>This function of the REALbasic plug-in option is available for Macintosh targets only.</p>
        <h4>Required Files</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>eSelleratePlugin.rbx<br />Located in the REALbasic:Plugins folder.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Macintosh Targets</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Resources 
                <br />Included in the development project. (If the project already contains a file named Resources, combine the resources of both files.)<br /><br />Because the eSellerate SDK does not include a file with this name, you will need to copy the file eSellerateEngine(Carbon).rsrc and rename the file Resources.

        <p class="pwNote"><span class="strong">Tip:</span> For the best protection against engine tampering, you should compile your application with the latest eSelleratePlugin.rbx, and include the latest eSellerateEngine as a resource. Next, use the API call <span class="strong">InstallEngine</span> immediately before any call that requires the eSellerateEngine. Calling <span class="strong">InstallEngine</span> replaces an altered eSellerateEngine, if one is present.</p>
